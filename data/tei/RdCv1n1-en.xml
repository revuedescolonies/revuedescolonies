                    <p> As of now, the colonies, generally speaking, only know of the great
                        principles of philanthropy in theory; of freedom in action, nothing at all. </p>
                    <p> The suffering and oppressed classes appeal and fight relentlessly, always in
                        vain. To stimulate the feeble good will to which our rulers limit
                        themselves, it is necessary to compile the just complaints that arise from
                        all sides. These claims, these grievances, to be successful, must receive
                        the greatest publicity: this is the object of our <bibl type="periodical"><title ref="#RdC">Revue</title></bibl>
                    </p>
                    <p> The debate floor <emph>today</emph> is no longer enough; petitions are
                        adjourned by the calculated negligence of rapporteurs or pushed back by the
                        insolent agendas of the day. On the other hand, colonial authorities, always
                        disposed in favor of the privileged, cleverly evade the ministers'
                        prescriptions. Against this hitherto successful tactic of the partisans of
                        aristocracy and privilege, it is necessary to finally engage the power of
                        public opinion, enlightened by a discussion always wise, always true, but
                        energetic and never timid, of the causes, whatever they may be, which hinder
                        the desirable fusion of the diverse populations of the colonies.<ptr target="#n4F2A"/>
                    </p>
                    <p> For this purpose, a specialized journal is founded under the title of <bibl type="periodical"><title ref="#RdC"> Revue des Colonies</title></bibl>,
                        with <persName ref="#CB">Mr. Bissette</persName> as director. </p>
                    <pb n="4" facs="v1n1p4"/>
                    <p> This journal is not only dedicated to all that concerns the colonies,
                        considered as a source of news and interesting facts apt to occupy the
                        leisure of the reader, but it devotes itself entirely to the political,
                        intellectual, moral and industrial interests of colonists of either
                            color.<ptr target="#n6CEA"/>
                    </p>
                    <p> Nothing that concerns the French colonies in particular will be omitted from
                        this monthly publication. The government, the administration, and the
                        justice system will be examined here with respect to both their actions and
                        their persons; for it is the latter that too often determines the spirit and
                        the manner in which populations are either oppressed or well looked
                        after.</p>
                    <p>  The civil, political, and social rights of the two free classes, which,
                        having been hitherto divided, ought to be united, will here be advanced and
                        supported with indefatigable zeal. </p>
                    <p> The great question of the abolition of slavery, the cornerstone of liberty,
                        will here be treated with the most conscientious care and the most ardent
                        love of equality and of the general good.<ptr target="#n79DB"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Arbitrariness and partiality will here be brought to face the court of public
                        opinion with no distinction between persons. The weak will find here support
                        and protection, the oppressor, punishment, the official, warranted blame for
                        his illegal acts, but respect for his person. </p>
                    <p> The <title ref="#RdC">Revue des Colonies</title> will also concern itself with all the
                        changes made or projected in the legislation that governs foreign colonies
                        and inevitably affects our own in a powerful way.<ptr target="#n5699"/>
                    </p>
                    <p> National interests, in relation to the possession of <placeName ref="#Alg">Algiers</placeName>, will find in the <title ref="#RdC">Revue des Colonies</title>

                        <p>The representatives of the French People, formed into a National
                            Assembly, considering ignorance, forgetfulness or contempt of the rights
                            of man to be the only causes of public misfortunes and the corruption of
                            Governments, have resolved to set forth, in a solemn Declaration, the
                            natural, unalienable and sacred rights of man, to the end that this
                            Declaration, constantly present to all members of the body politic, may
                            remind them unceasingly of their rights and their duties; to the end
                            that the acts of the legislative power and those of the executive power,
                            since they may be continually compared with the aim of every political
                            institution, may thereby be the more respected; to the end that the
                            demands of the citizens, founded henceforth on simple and incontestable
                            principles, may always be directed toward the maintenance of the
                            Constitution and the happiness of all. </p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="v1n1p6"/>
                        <p> In consequence whereof, the National Assembly recognizes and declares,
                            in the presence and under the auspices of the Supreme Being, the
                            following Rights of Man and of the Citizen. </p>
                        <p xml:id="art1">Article 1.-Men are born and remain free and equal in
                            rights. Social distinctions may be based only on considerations of the
                            common good.</p>
                        <p>2.- The aim of every political association is the preservation of the
                            natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are Liberty,
                            Property, Safety and Resistance to Oppression.</p>
                        <p xml:id="art3">3.-The source of all sovereignty lies essentially in the
                            Nation. No corporate body, no individual may exercise any authority that
                            does not expressly emanate from it.</p>
                        <p>4.- Liberty consists in being able to do anything that does not harm
                            others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of every man has no
                            bounds other than those that ensure to the other members of society the
                            enjoyment of these same rights. These bounds may be determined only by
                            Law.</p>
                        <p><gap reason="accidental" unit="number" extent="1"/><supplied>5.-</supplied> The Law has the right to forbid only
                            those actions that are injurious to society. Nothing that is not
                            forbidden by Law may be hindered, and no one may be compelled to do what
                            the Law does not ordain.</p>
                        <p><choice>
                                <sic>5.-</sic>
                                <corr>6.-</corr>
                            </choice>The Law is the expression of the general will. All citizens
                            have the right to take part, personally or through their
                            representatives, in its making. It must be the same for all, whether it
                            protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, shall be
                            equally eligible to all high offices, public positions and employments,
                            according to their ability, and without other distinction than that of
                            their virtues and talents.</p>
                        <p>7.- No man may be accused, arrested or detained except in the cases
                            determined by the Law, and following the procedure that it has
                            prescribed. Those who solicit, expedite, carry out, or cause to be
                            carried out arbitrary orders must be punished; but any citizen summoned
                            or apprehended by virtue of the Law, must give instant obedience;
                            resistance makes him guilty.</p>
                        <p> 8.- The Law must prescribe only the punishments that are strictly and
                            evidently necessary; and no one may be punished except by virtue of a
                            Law drawn up and promulgated before the offense is committed, and
                            legally applied.</p>
                        <p>9.- As every man is presumed innocent until he has <pb n="7" facs="v1n1p7"/> been declared guilty, if it should be considered
                            necessary to arrest him, any undue harshness that is not required to
                            secure his person must be severely curbed by Law.</p>
                        <p>10. - No one may be disturbed on account of his opinions, even religious
                            ones, as long as the manifestation of such opinions does not interfere
                            with the established Law and Order.</p>
                        <p>11.- The free communication of ideas and of opinions is one of the most
                            precious rights of man. Any citizen may therefore speak, write and
                            publish freely, except what is tantamount to the abuse of this liberty
                            in the cases determined by Law.</p>
                        <p>12.- To guarantee the Rights of Man and of the Citizen a public force is
                            necessary; this force is therefore established for the benefit of all,
                            and not for the particular use of those to whom it is entrusted.</p>
                        <p>13. For the maintenance of the public force, and for administrative
                            expenses, a general tax is indispensable; it must be equally distributed
                            among all citizens, in proportion to their ability to pay.</p>
                        <p>14. All citizens have the right to ascertain, by themselves, or through
                            their representatives, the need for a public tax, to consent to it
                            freely, to watch over its use, and to determine its proportion, basis,
                            collection and duration.</p>
                        <p>15. Society has the right to ask a public official for an accounting of
                            his administration.</p>
                        <p>16. Any society in which no provision is made for guaranteeing rights or
                            for the separation of powers, has no Constitution.</p>
                        <p xml:id="art17">17.- Since the right to Property is inviolable and sacred,
                            no one may be deprived thereof, unless public necessity, legally
                            ascertained, obviously requires it, and just and prior indemnity has
                            been paid.</p>

                        there is in these principles, which the French revolution, by its republican
                        and imperial armies, has sown acrossed the land of
                            <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and by its books everywhere in the
                        universe, a power which cannot be suppressed. </p>
                    <p>Certainly, if a man should be reminded of anything, it is his rights, which
                        aristocracies may well succeed in making obsolete here and there, but to
                        which the future belongs.</p>
                    <p>We ask that we compare the present state of our legislation with this page of
                        justice and liberty, that we examine whether the laws that are made for us
                        are in conformity with the principles of this declaration, which must be
                        forever, according to the fine expression of the <orgName ref="#AN">National
                            Assembly</orgName>, <emph>the law of the legislators themselves</emph>.
                        And if this examination clearly shows that the government, whatever it may
                        be, is not founded on this one equitable basis — the enforcement of the
                        rights of all — those who, like us and with the <orgName ref="#AN">National
                            Assembly</orgName>, will be convinced that <emph>ignorance,
                            forgetfulness or contempt for the rights of man are the only causes of
                            public misfortunes and the corruption of governments</emph>, will
                        triumphantly conclude that all the evil of the present situation, in the
                        colonies as everywhere, is absolutely a result of this ignorance, of this
                        forgetfulness or of this contempt, we cannot precisely say which, as much on
                        the part of the rulers as on that of the governed.</p>

                    <head>A LOOK AT THE COLONIAL REGIME AND ITS EFFECTS.</head>
                    <p>The deplorable events of Grand'Anse, <ptr target="#n590A"/>
                        <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName> have echoed through every
                        newspaper. Some, inspired by the authorities, in whose eyes all that is
                        emancipation becomes an object of terror, have presented this affair in an
                        unfavorable light to those who have limited themselves to passive
                            resistance.<ptr target="#n684A"/> Others, more benevolent, and above
                        all, more impartial, were careful not to pass premature judgment on a matter
                        of this nature: they knew that passion exaggerates both evil and good, and
                        that one should not <pb n="9" facs="v1n1p9"/>rush to adopt the words of a
                        powerful and often unjust party. </p>
                    <p>We too will attend to this matter, but by prefacing it with all the
                        considerations necessary to draw the correct conclusions.</p>
                    <p>These facts, which seem to us hardly believable, are repeated every day with
                        impunity in our colonies. And how could it not be so, when the men charged
                        with maintaining the laws are those most interested in violating them!
                        Arbitrariness is therefore only the sad corollary of a state of affairs
                        whose origins date back to a time of conquest, plunder and brutal violence.
                        We know that this arbitrariness exists; philosophy has decried it; power
                        itself seems to reject a shameful solidarity, and yet nothing real has been
                        done to put an end to it. Everything has been deceit and lies, from the
                        illusory measures against the slave trade, to the laws which seem to grant
                        men of color the rights of citizens, and a justice which one could not
                        truthfully represent scales in the hand.</p>
                    <p>These causes, which, deriving from the overall regime of the colonies, would
                        seem foreign to the events of Grand'Anse, to which we will attend more
                        particularly, <ptr target="#n65C6"/> are nevertheless attached to them by a
                        multitude of threads: for nothing in the fate of peoples, as in that of men,
                        is isolated, and the actual effects are often produced by causes lost to the
                        depths of time.</p>
                    <p>The colonies too, despite their distance from the motherland, felt the
                        effects of the great political commotion which regenerated
                            <placeName>France</placeName>. A long subjugation, largely exploited by
                        the aristocracy, had not been able to paralyze hearts so much that they did
                        not feel warmed by the rays of the sun of freedom. Men of color especially,
                        more advantaged than the unfortunate slaves, turned their eyes towards
                        France with love and confidence; they felt that each link which fell from
                        the chains of old Europe was for them a pledge of emancipation. The
                        emblazoned nobility, elevated to the rank of people, offered an edifying
                        lesson to the nobility of the skin,<ptr target="#n2BFD"/> which did not even
                        possess the prestige of the former's personal accomplishments. The
                        destruction of one was the sure guarantee of the destruction of the other.
                        Was not the emancipation of the people, who had long suffered the bondage
                            <pb n="10" facs="v1n1p10"/>of the field, also a sign of freedom for the
                        slaves? There was therefore in the colonies what is still there today, an
                        absurd aristocracy clinging to its privileges and willing to go to any
                        length to preserve them, and on the other hand a population full of verve,
                        of energy, beginning to understand its rights and its dignity. </p>
                    <p>Such, then, was the position of the colonies when the July revolution,<ptr target="#n9F29"/> so rich in prospects, made conceivable for a moment
                        the awakening of France. The new government, carried along, no doubt in
                        spite of itself, by the force of circumstance, not daring to lift the veil
                        which hid its ulterior motives, finally bowing before public opinion which
                        had just had its impact felt, erased the word <emph>regulations</emph> from
                        the article of the charter concerning the colonies. It declared that the
                        colonies would be governed by special <emph>laws</emph><ptr target="#n3257"/>. This tacit recognition of abuses of all kinds, originating in the
                        corrupted system of ordinences, stoked the hopes of those who could still
                        put some faith in ministers' promises. It was because they did not believe
                        that a government born of democracy could so quickly forget its origin; they
                        did not comprehend that the preservation of titles of nobility, of a
                        so-called upper chamber, and above all of an exaggerated civil list were
                        milestones laid down by the nascent power to constitute itself on bases
                        similar to that which the popular arm had just crushed. Did not the
                        preservation of the titled nobility in the motherland,<ptr target="#n917D"/>
                        and the addition that was made to it of a Turcarets aristrocracy,<ptr target="#n9C9A"/> clearly impart to the colonies that, except for a few
                        slight adjustments, their aristocracy of skin would be preserved along with
                        most of its privileges.</p>
                    <p>Indeed these fine particular <emph>laws</emph> were rendered so illusory as
                        to match the ordinances' arbitrariness,<ptr target="#n332A"/> differing from
                        them only by the hypocrisy of the name. For example, is not the electoral
                        law, establishing the political rights of whites and of men of color, a work
                        of perfidious deception? On the <placeName ref="#BrB">isle of
                            Bourbon</placeName> and of <placeName ref="#Cay">Cayenne</placeName>,
                        where the whites are in overwhelming majority, the electoral qualification
                        and eligibility are fixed at a lower rate, for there is no fear of
                        competition; but in the colonies of <placeName ref="#GP">Guadeloupe
                        </placeName> and <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>, where the
                        population of color, quite numerous, is of <pb n="11" facs="v1n1p11"/>average wealth, the tax is preemptively raised to an unattainable level.
                        Is there anything more perfidious, I would even say more odiously ironic,
                        than to thus concede the right while prohibiting the means. Would it not
                        have been truer to declare outright that only whites could vote?<ptr target="#n0490"/></p>
                    <p>It became difficult, in the presence of this law of political organization,
                        creating or rather sanctioning a privilege, to allow for the action of the
                        popular will. The national guard, that admirable institution of the
                            métropole,<ptr target="#n5F16"/> had a pale imitation in the colonies,
                        where both the name and the democratic element of election were carefully
                        banished.</p>
                    <p>If France has a national guard, the colonies have a militia whose officers,
                        appointed by the governor, are generally taken from the white population and
                        from among a few men of color. These, to keep a rank obtained by favor,
                        devote themselves unquestioningly to the governor and become his
                        accomplices. We hasten to say that, among those promoted, we count friends
                        who have not wavered in their political opinions, but not all of them are
                        so. When power makes itself odious by its partiality, it always corrupts the
                        men who make themselves its supporters. What bonds can indeed unite men who
                        find themselves in a position so false as the colonial militia and its
                        leaders? Trust? It does not exist. Fraternity? it would be vain to search
                        for it there. So there remains only force, and it is indeed felt
                        everyday.</p>
                    <p>In the judicial system, abuses abound, and they are always to the advantage
                        of the aristocratic class. The royal courts and the magistrates' courts are
                        constituted in such a way as to let the whites become judges and parties in
                        their own cause. Finally, despite the very text of the charter, provost
                        courts can still bloody the soil of the colonies by legally assassinating
                        the innocent people they want to get rid of.</p>
                    <p>Well! in the presence of this boundless arbitrariness, leaning on their
                        numerous privileges, the whites groan and complain that the government has
                        dared to touch the holy ark of their power, by diminishing some of their
                        privileges. Political rights, they possess them all; the judicial power is
                        in their hands; law enforcement, they<pb n="12" facs="v1n1p12"/> direct and
                        command it; but it is not enough to suit their wounded pride. A principle,
                        admittedly without application, has been issued; the word equality was
                        spoken, was it not enough to offend those selfish and hard hearts for whom
                        every independent man who is not part of their league is but a worthless
                        rebellious slave?<ptr target="#n3701"/> Men of color, on the contrary,
                        confident in the government's feeble pledges of good will, waited patiently
                        for better days perfecting their political education so as to wield the
                        influence that they are entitled to in their country by their rights and
                        numbers. And what do they really want that is not wise and reasonable?
                        Placed in their land in the same position as the third estate in France
                        before the revolution, they then ask what this order commanded: liberty and
                        equality. But they are dealing with privileged people who are even more
                        tenacious than the nobility and clergy of France. These at least did not
                        have the impudence to deny the title of men to their adversaries.<ptr target="#n8508"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>By what means, then, could the privileged recover the integrity of their
                        privileges? To ask the government for them was impossible, they would have
                        been told to bide their time; that the compromise was only a matter of
                        painful necessity; that, moreover, the liberties granted to the mulattoes
                        were purely illusory, being limited in reality to a few slight concessions
                        of sociability.<ptr target="#n6759"/> And furthermore these same concessions
                        often bend according to the whims of the aristocracy. These answers, which
                        would satisfy less impatient, and above all less prideful men, would have
                        deeply wounded those imperious masters whose despotism is exercised without
                        control over unfortunate slaves. It was therefore necessary to employ all
                        means, even calumny, to subjugate the class of color and crush it.<ptr target="#n7A20"/> It had to be represented as factious, turbulent,
                        having sworn to destroy the whites and stopping at nothing, not murder, not
                        arson, to accomplish this. It is so easy to slander men who are not allowed
                        to defend themselves! To find guilty the enemy that one judges oneself! And
                        then the colonies also count among their ranks men who know how to create
                        conspiracies, foment them, cause them to arise at the right time, in order
                        to take advantage of them in their own interest. And what does it really
                        matter that the worthless blood of a few negroes comes to redden the ground!
                        What does it matter if a mulatto's head rolls on<pb n="13" facs="v1n1p13"/>
                        the scaffold! Mere trifles, when you consider the glorious result expected
                        of it; that is, the bondage of the many for the benefit of the few. Besides,
                        the métropole offers a few examples which would seem to authorize the
                        colonies in this Machiavellianism.</p>
                    <p>And so we have seen the birth of these imaginary plots, these conflagrations
                        whose frequency during certain periods bespeaks frightful mysteries.
                        Innocents have been accused, thrown into dungeons, tortured, shot without
                        pity when they allowed themselves a few complaints. Neither sex nor age
                        could soften these ferocious men who subject their slaves to the most
                        sophisticated cruelties, and their gold, thrown at the heads of the
                        proconsuls of the great nation, hides large stains of blood from their
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>Ah! if some day an eloquent pen tearing the funereal veil which covers our
                        colonies, would retrace the history of domination of the possessors of men;
                        if it evoked from the depths of their tombs the sad victims who are heaped
                        there every day, never would a country defiled by tyranny offer such
                        horrible pages.<ptr target="#n4C92"/> All that we read of the Mésences, the
                        Caligulas, the Louis XIs,<ptr target="#n5DA0"/> all that our hearts refuse
                        to believe as too degrading for humanity, finds itself surpassed in the
                        nineteenth century by overseas Frenchmen. But these horrible scenes of
                        despotism have no place here, elsewhere we will reveal them by throwing the
                        names of their infamous authors among the ignominies of history. </p>

                        heirs of <persName><emph>Fréjus</emph></persName>, left for dead under the
                        blows of a <persName>Lasserre</persName> and since deceased as a result of
                        the violence exercised against him; the heirs of
                                <persName><emph>Maurice</emph></persName>
                        <pb n="14" facs="v1n1p14"/>killed with his wife, and his daughter murdered
                        by a volley shot through their hut; <persName ref="#JosA"><emph>Joseph Albert</emph></persName>, deported in <date>1823</date>, wounded in that
                        other shooting carried out on the prisoners of the Bonafon purgerie, through
                        the window gratings, etc., etc. </p>
                    <p>Admittedly, such victims, immolated not in a conflict, not in an armed
                        struggle between the authorities and such and such part of the population,
                        but murdered in their prison, in their home after having surrendered on the
                        faith of fallacious promises; such victims raising their voices to the
                        mother country seemed worthy of some attention on the part of the
                        ministry.</p>
                    <p>With what painful indignation will our fellow citizens of the colonies be
                        seized when they learn how the <persName ref="#GVD">the Minister of the
                            Navy</persName> welcomed their request to the <persName ref="#LP"><roleName>king</roleName></persName> in his council for
                        authorization to prosecute the authors or culprits of these saturnalia of
                        arbitrariness and bloodshed! The
                            <persName ref="#GVD"><roleName>minister</roleName></persName> to whom the request
                        was communicated, according to custom, contented himself with the following
                        short and disdainful observations: <q>I will not discuss the facts because
                            the majority of the plaintiffs are included in the trial currently being
                            heard in <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>. The <bibl type="periodical"><title ref="#MU">Moniteur</title></bibl> of
                                <date>March 17</date> has moreover published a <emph>report
                                emanating from <persName ref="#JHD"><roleName>the
                                    governor</roleName></persName></emph> (that is to say, the
                            person whom the plaintiffs accuse) which, given the confidence he is
                            owed, cannot be entered alongside the account of individuals compromised
                            in the accusation.</q></p>
                    <p>Then, soon shedding his affected respect for the position of the
                            accused,<persName ref="#GVD">
                            <roleName> the minister</roleName></persName> ends his letter by calling
                        them <emph>factious men</emph>, rehashing in banal and hackneyed phrases the
                        commonplaces of the day: <q> That it would be dangerous to entertain their
                                <emph>recriminations</emph> at a time when so many and such culpable
                            attempts are directed against public peace. Such is the opinion of the
                            Department of the Navy on the recourse of plaintiffs to the Council of
                            State. We like to believe that this high jurisdiction will follow
                            inspirations that are more generous, more equitable, more friendly to
                            humanity.</q></p>
                    <p>Yes, indeed, some of the plaintiffs–that is to say <emph>three</emph>, not
                        the <emph>majority</emph>–are destined to feature in the sad trial which is
                        currently being staged in <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>; but the others,
                        but those who died unarmed, prisoners, under the soldiers’ bullets, those
                        will not go to the assizes. How can one counter <pb n="15" facs="v1n1p15"/>in cold blood the complaints of their wives and children with this cruel
                        denial of justice? Whatever the result of the trial, even if it were to
                        prove the existence of the alleged conspiracy, could it ever justify the
                        local government’s massacre of conspirators who had been captured, disarmed
                        and who were held prisoners, kept in sight, besieged on all sides by law
                        enforcement? will it absolve local authorities for letting these unfortunate
                        victims fall under a rain of murderous lead? </p>
                    <p>We know today in France what procedure was initiated because of the events of
                        Grand'Anse. We have before us a printed copy of the order for remand to the
                        assizes, issued by the indictment chamber, against 117 defendants. This
                        document notes what we have just said, that only three of those who have
                        addressed a request to the Council of State are referred to the Assizes of
                            <placeName ref="#StP">Saint-Pierre</placeName>. This decision also authentically
                        establishes the facts stated in the request, and which the <persName ref="#GVD"><roleName>Minister of the Navy</roleName></persName> disdains
                        to discuss, in particular <emph>the shooting carried out on
                                <persName>Lorville</persName> and two other prisoners fleeing with
                            him, by express order of the captain in command</emph> (pages 51 and 55
                        of the indictment). As for the massacre of the
                                <persName><emph>Maurice</emph></persName> family, it is
                        acknowledged, albeit in a somewhat distorted account, by this same
                            <title ref="#MU">Moniteur</title> of <date>March 17</date>, whose sincerity seems
                        less doubtful than that of the plaintiffs, but from which nevertheless the
                        Minister has removed certain, overly clumsy, passages of the <persName ref="#EH"><roleName>governor</roleName></persName>'s report. Are facts
                        so incontestable unworthy of the solicitude of the government? do they not
                        deserve examination, investigation, adversarial discussion with the
                            <persName ref="#GVD"><roleName>Minister</roleName></persName>? There are
                        a host of others also specified in the request, all those who denounce to
                        the métropole for the hundredth time the systematic oppression of the
                        classes of color, the daily provocations directed against them, the
                        continued denial of all their rights in defiance of the laws that grant
                        them, finally all those others which give true color to the events of
                            <placeName>la Grand'Anse</placeName>. But what does it matter! all these
                        facts of high political and social importance will be omitted, concealed,
                        denied if necessary, and in all cases excused. What the so-called official
                        and authentic relations of the <title ref="#MU"><emph>Moniteur</emph></title> will
                        show to the colonies, to France, is <emph>one hundred and <pb n="16" facs="v1n1p16"/>seventeen conspiratorrs</emph> appearing in court
                        under the weight of a 300-page charge, all accused of conspiracy, for the
                        government of <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName> needs one; then each one in
                        particular accused of having looted two jars of tafia and two jars of rum
                        from <persName><emph>Seguinot</emph></persName>; or from
                                <persName><emph>Desmadrelles</emph></persName>, soap, candles, a
                        horse's currycomb; or from <persName><emph>Lereynerie</emph></persName>, a
                        bottle of jenever (pages 85 and 86 of the order for reference). And all this
                        printed by the government of the colony over 200 pages, pompously titled, by
                        the most ignorant of magistrates, <rs type="event"><emph>Insurrection of
                                Grand'Anse</emph></rs>.</p>
                    <p>What of the permanent conspiracy against the rights and personal safety of
                        the population of color! the permanent insurrection of the whites against
                        the laws of the métropole, every day shamelessly spurned by these colonists
                        from the north of the colony, made infamous by the mass proscription of
                        1823, by their declaration to the government that they would never recognize
                        men of color as their equals! What is being done about these conspiracies
                        that reappear every day, always going unpunished?</p>
                    <p>Wretched colonies! will it ever be your fate to pointlessly show your wounds
                        to the motherland, only for our incredulous rulers to not even deign probe
                        it with their fingers!</p>

                <div xml:id="speech">
                    <head>A WORD ON THE SPEECH DELIVERED BY MR. ISAMBERT AT THE SESSION OF THIS PAST
                        MAY 8TH.</head>
                    <p> If experience is the touchstone of all legislation, we cannot disagree that
                        the organic law for the colonies promulgated in 1833 is essentially
                        defective; for the results it has produced are detestable; <persName ref="#FI">Mr. Isambert</persName> demonstrated this abundantly. The
                        commission charged with examining this law unanimously recognized, he tells
                        us, that it was desirable that men of color be admitted to the colonial
                        council. Well! With the exception of <placeName ref="#GF">French
                            Guiana</placeName>, in each of our colonies and notably in the most
                        important of all, <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>, this council
                        was formed exclusively of white colonists. This fundamental flaw in
                        composition is an insurmountable obstacle </p>
                    <pb n="17" facs="v1n1p17"/>
                    <p>to the introduction of the reforms that the situation in our colonies
                        urgently demands. In support of this assertion, Mr. Isambert cites a fact
                        that is well worth repeating here: the governor of Martinique presented
                        various draft royal ordinances to the colonial council regarding the
                        reorganization of militias, the form and conditions of manumission, the
                        advice to be given regarding municipal and judicial organization, etc. Here
                        is how the council responded: <q>The colonial council pays tribute to the
                            government's intentions on behalf of the king, but often the measures
                            taken to achieve this goal, instead of attaining it, lead to disastrous
                            results. We will immediately focus on the 1834 budget.</q> Frankly, is
                        this not a clear rejection of the governor's proposals? Is this not telling
                        him that his suggestions are not even worth considering? Therefore, without
                        a second thought, the council will immediately move on to the budget. Does
                        this display of disdain and directness not perfectly illustrate the
                        aristocratic arrogance of our very high and mighty masters by <emph>right of
                            whiteness</emph>? </p>
                    <p>Vis-à-vis this impertinent response, the honorable deputy placed the generous
                        words by which the colonial council of French Guiana not only promised its
                        assistance in all the improvement projects presented by the governor, but
                        even committed to initiating reforms on many points. Why were these
                        proposals received so differently in one of the colonies compared to the
                        other? It is because the 1833 law was even more restrictive in granting
                        suffrage rights to people of color in Martinique and <placeName ref="#GP">Guadeloupe</placeName>, than to those residing in French Guiana. </p>
                    <p><q>It wouldn't be the case,</q>says Mr. Isambert, <q><emph>if a few men of
                                color</emph> (I say some because I don't claim to want the classes,
                            which have remained in complete isolation up to now, to have the same
                            advantage as the Creole class), but again, if a few men of color were
                            admitted to the colonial council.</q> One can see that the illustrious
                        legal expert is here displaying a conciliatory attitude and playing a bit
                        too nicely to the colonial aristocracy; therefore, it is our duty to protest
                        against a </p>
                    <pb n="18" facs="v1n1p18"/>
                    <p>concession that would do nothing less than uphold privilege and be an attack
                        on the great principle of equality.</p>
                    <p>We would regret it if one were to perceive even the shadow of a reproach in
                        our words. We know all too well Mr. Isambert’s conscientious integrity and
                        love of justice to find in this departure from a principle anything other
                        than a momentary lapse. Moreover, Mr. Isambert's generous instincts quickly
                        lead him back to common law. A few lines further, he indeed speaks out
                        against the bias of the electoral system, which, out of ten voters, only
                        admits one voter of color, even though the population of this class is three
                        times that of the whites. This obviously denies every man of color access to
                        the colonial council. On this matter, it is essential to return to the
                        principle proclaimed by the Constituent Assembly, which granted the right to
                        vote to every free man, aged twenty-five or older, owning property, or
                        residing in the municipality for two years and paying a tax.</p>
                    <p>A portion of the discourse we are examining is dedicated to highlighting the
                        monstrous flaws that abound in the judicial organization of Martinique,
                        particularly in criminal justice. There, it seems that everything has been
                        designed to deprive unfortunate litigants of any chance of acquittal. For
                        instance, a court of assizes is composed of three counselors from the royal
                        court and four members of the board of assessors, an institution that
                        reflects the jury. All of them are exclusively selected from the white
                        class. The four assessors are drawn by lot from a list of thirty members,
                        but this list is further reduced by illnesses, absences, or any other
                        impediments to twenty men per assize; the decision is made by the majority
                        of votes from this kind of jury combined with that of the court, consisting
                        of three judges. So, assuming unanimity from the court and the jury, the
                        verdict is rendered with a number of votes lower than what is required of a
                        jury in France; thus, four votes are sufficient in the colonies to pass a
                        death sentence, whereas in France, eight are required for a criminal
                        conviction, and English law, even more humane, demands unanimous jury
                        agreement for all types of convictions. </p>
                    <p>If you add to all of this the fact that in the colonies, men of </p>
                    <pb n="19" facs="v1n1p19"/>
                    <p>color are constantly in competition with whites, and the intense and bitter
                        animosities that divide them often lead to disputes that are interpreted as
                        conspiracies, wouldn't you conclude that placing the sword of justice solely
                        in the hands of the Creole inevitably turns it into an instrument of revenge
                        and cruelty? That it leaves men of color at the mercy of their enemies, and
                        to maintain such a state of affairs any longer would demonstrate a barbaric
                        indifference to human life and a heinous disregard for the sacred laws of
                        justice. Judicial reorganization is all the more urgent because, as a result
                        of the sad events in Grand'Anse, a hundred and seventeen people are
                        currently facing a capital charge. </p>

                <p>Men of color have owed improvements in their condition to the progress of public
                    opinion. Since 1830, they have finally obtained the political rights that were
                    denied to them for so long by individuals who were still interested in
                    maintaining their subjugation. The humiliating distinctions that justly offended
                    their wounded self-esteem and deprived them of the exercise of a natural right
                    have finally disappeared. Today, they are an integral part of the great French
                    family without restrictions. They are French citizens or eligible to become
                    such. They can rightfully take pride in this qualification, which allows them to
                    sit in the midst of the sovereign people, sharing in its sovereignty. However,
                    they should also know that this civilization's blessing has imposed new
                    responsibilities on them, the fulfillment of which is essential to maintaining
                    the high status they have achieved through the triumph of freedom. </p>
                <p>It is to science that civilization owes its triumphant progress through the
                    prejudices accumulated over the centuries. More precisely, civilization itself
                    has been nothing more than the conquest of science. This is the noblest
                    achievement of the human mind, and freedom, the offspring of civilization, could
                    have no other origin than its mother. Science, civilization, and freedom are
                    therefore inseparable correlates that presuppose and call each other, and they
                    cannot exist separately. </p>
                <pb n="20" facs="v1n1p20"/>
                <p>One would have to hold a deeply false idea of freedom to believe that it could
                    securely establish itself in a country inhabited by men hostile to or, at the
                    very least, apathetic towards education. The air one breathes in the abode of
                    ignorance, prejudices, and shameful passions is mephitic to freedom. Freedom
                    wants to be worshiped only by men with generous ideas and elevated sentiments
                    who, through study, may appreciate her benefactions, offer her a pure and worthy
                    devotion, and defend her against the attacks of her enemies.</p>
                <p>Men of color must, therefore, abandon the independence they are so proud of today
                    and the hope of acquiring any influence in the affairs of their country if they
                    do not promote education among themselves. If a base and disastrous selfishness
                    prevents them from making the necessary sacrifices for the education of their
                    children in France. Today more than ever, they must feel this need: did not the
                    colonial council of <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName> Martinique, in
                    its first session, recently abolish the monitorial schools created by <persName ref="#AA">Mr. d'Argout</persName> during his time as Minister of the Navy? </p>
                <p>In the current state of affairs in the colonies, the political emancipation of
                    men of color and their inclusion in the great French family is undoubtedly a
                    cause for joy for each of them. However, what a source of humiliation do the
                    majority of them find when, in the exercise of their new rights, they are put in
                    contact with individuals well-versed in business and possessing specialized and
                    diverse knowledge.</p>
                <p>The education of women is even more backward than that of men. A regrettable
                    silence, when they are in society, diminishes their charm and takes away what
                    would be most appealing.</p>
                <p>Don't place them alongside one of those Parisian women whose conversation is so
                    lively, pleasant, and captivating. Nevertheless, nature has not been any less
                    generous to the children of the colonies than to those of France: provide young
                    individuals from the colonies with the same education, and soon the riches of
                    their passionate imagination will be revealed. They will shine and captivate,
                    just like our witty French women, with the diversity of their conversation and
                    the indescribable charm of their remarks.</p>
                <p>We implore men of color not to judge our <pb n="21" facs="v1n1p21"/>criticisms as
                    overly severe. It is a friendly voice that speaks to them. Let them heed the
                    advice of men who constantly fight for the triumph of their cause and fear the
                    possibility of their emancipation being incomplete or even fruitless. If men of
                    color do not know how to break free from the state of torpor in which they
                    languish, let them tremble in their apathetic ignorance. The links of their
                    chains are scattered and broken, it is true, but an ambitious and bold hand
                    could weld them together once more. A governor of the caliber of a <persName ref="#HF">Freycinet</persName> and a <persName ref="#FXD">Donzelot</persName>, can make them lose all their advantages. A prosecutor
                    general as capable as <persName ref="#RL">RICHARD LUCY</persName>, can annul
                    even the most firmly established concessions. Let them consider the events; they
                    are far from offering them complete security.</p>
                <p>Their freedom will only be stable, unassailable, and their status as French
                    citizens definitively secured when their children attend our schools and join
                    various branches of the administration in large numbers. We will have confidence
                    in their future only when we see them enrolling significant numbers of students
                    in institutions of higher learning such as <orgName ref="#PO">Polytechnique</orgName>, <orgName ref="#StCyr">Saint-Cyr</orgName>,
                    Medicine, Law, Commerce, and the Navy. It is then, and only then, that they will
                    acquire the local influence and respect they covet and achieve the integration
                    from which they are yet so far removed.</p>
                <p>As this is a matter of vital importance about which we could not possibly call
                    the attention of our friends from the colonies too much, we will dedicate a
                    series of articles on this same subject, and will propose a plan to realize our
                    educational project and to neutralize in the same movement the efforts of the
                    colonial aristocracy, which toward depriving the masses of education in order to
                    better exploit them.</p>

                <head>THE ELECTORAL QUESTION.</head>

                <p>A new question has arisen in electoral matters in the colonies: whether an
                    unmarried woman can delegate her contributions to her legally recognized natural
                    son.</p>
                <p>The Director General of the Interior in <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>, acting as <pb n="22" facs="v1n1p22"/>prefect, has
                    refused to recognize such delegation for the following reason: <q><p>To grant an
                            unmarried woman the right to delegate would be to give an arbitrary
                            extension to a provision that is already inherently exceptional by its
                            nature.</p>
                        <p>We have decided and hereby declare the following: <persName ref="#SUG">Mr. Sugnin (Philippe-Simon-Eudoxie)</persName> in the current state
                            of affairs, cannot be registered on the electoral list of the 4th
                            constituency. At <placeName ref="#FoR">Fort-Royal</placeName>
                                (<placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>), <date>April 19th, 1833</date>
                            <emph>Signed</emph>
                            <persName ref="#RS">viscount ROSILY</persName>.</p></q></p>
                <p>The citizen affected by this decision neglected to appeal to the royal court for
                    its revision within ten days of its notification, as stipulated by the law.</p>
                <p>Since this issue may arise frequently in the colonies, where a considerable
                    number of unmarried women with legally recognized natural children can be found,
                    we will provide observations against this decision in line with the spirit of
                    the law.</p>
                <p>The argument upon which the decision we are contesting is based is the same one
                    that was opposed to us during the Restoration when we argued, according to the
                    law of February 5, 1817, that the delegation right belonged to divorced women
                    and women legally separated, in favor of grandsons-in-law as well as
                    sons-in-law.</p>
                <p>How did the <orgName ref="#CE">Council of State</orgName> respond, given that it
                    was dominated by the system of government of the time, which aimed to restrict
                    rather than extend the exercise of political rights?</p>
                <p>Following a request presented by us on behalf of <persName ref="#AR">Mr.
                        Aroux</persName>, now a deputy (February 11, 1824), it responded that <q>to
                        grant the grandson-in-law a right that the law had limited to the son-in-law
                        would be to give an arbitrary extension to an exceptional provision.</q> The
                    1831 law has put an end to this quibbling.</p>
                <p>The 1817 law did not mention the adoptive mother; however, in a decision passed
                    on September 9, 1830, the <orgName ref="#CRN">Royal Court of Nancy</orgName>
                    ruled that she had the right to delegate. Since then, even though divorce has
                    not been reinstated, upon our proposal in 1831, the <orgName ref="#CHD">Chamber
                        of Deputies</orgName> has had no qualms admitting divorced women, like
                    legally separated women, to the delegation right.</p>
                <pb n="23" facs="v1n1p23"/>
                <p>Isn't the unmarried woman, who cannot exercise political rights attached to
                    property ownership by herself, in exactly the same social position as the
                    divorced woman and the legally separated woman?</p>
                <p>In <placeName>France</placeName>, In France, where morals are much stricter than
                    in the colonies, one could consider <persName ref="#RS">Mr. Viscount de
                        Rosily</persName> 's decision as a tribute to good morals.</p>
                <p>But he did not want to include this reason in his decree; it would have been a
                    condemnation of an ingrained practice in the colonies, which magistrates like
                        <persName ref="#DES">Mr. Dessalles</persName>, in the annals of
                        <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>, have argued is justified by the heat of
                    the climate.</p>
                <p>We believe that, in addition to this consideration, there is another more
                    compelling one. The number of voters is greatly restricted in the colonies,
                    especially in the colored class. Far from there being a political motive to
                    restrict the exercise of rights created by the 1833 law in favor of citizens of
                    this class who could provide the desired property guarantees, the most vigorous
                    support has been expressed for their expansion by the king's commissioners and
                    the defenders of the law within the commission of which we were a part, but also
                    within the chamber and beyond.</p>
                <p>The decision in question is therefore contrary to the spirit of the law, the
                    spirit of all electoral legislation, which, when in doubt, seeks not to restrict
                    the right but to expand it. <placeName ref="#Par">Paris</placeName>, <date>July 2nd,

                        specifically mentions the widow and the legally separated woman, which

                <head>A <emph>DE FACTO</emph> FREEDMAN’S APPEAL.</head>

                <p>A significant question regarding slavery has come before the <orgName ref="#CDC">Court of Cassation</orgName>.</p>
                <p>Two young men were convicted by the Assize Court of <placeName ref="#GF">French
                        Guiana</placeName>, along with a free man of color who did not file an
                    appeal in cassation. Both of his co-accused were considered slaves throughout
                    the proceedings. However, one of them, <persName ref="#CJ">Cyprien
                        Jacquard</persName>, argued that he was in a state of manumission because he
                    had been bequeathed by his master to his emancipated mother, so as to provide
                    him and other children with a means of livelihood.</p>
                <p>When this case was first presented, the <orgName ref="#CDC">Court of Cassation</orgName> was
                    struck by the odiousness of considering a child as a slave to his mother, whom
                    she could potentially sell. It could happen that a mother was bequeathed by a
                    master to her own son, and he might also be in a position to alienate her. Would
                    such a reversal of the laws of nature be sanctioned by colonial legislation? </p>
                <p>The court, in a ruling dated January 10, 1834, ordered that the facts be verified
                    before making a decision on the appeal.</p>
                <p>As a result of the information gathered in compliance with this ruling, it was
                    found that Jacquard's mother, upon gaining her freedom from her master, had
                    received her children born of him, as well as her own mother, as part of her
                    bequest. Subsequent to Jacquard's conviction, this woman made the required
                    declarations at the civil registry office, as per the Ordinance of July 12,
                    1832, to obtain her son’s emancipation certificate.</p>
                <p>Given this situation, the Attorney General of the colony argued that Jacquard,
                    the appellant in cassation, was not admissible to file an appeal in cassation.
                    This was because, as per the colonial ordinance of July 20, 1828, Article 9,
                    which the Criminal Procedure Code, since promulgated, does not override, slaves
                    are prohibited from using this appeal, and Jacquard was still a slave at the
                    time of the alleged crime and his conviction.</p>
                <p>At the hearing on June 26, <persName ref="#DEH">Counselor Dehaussy</persName>
                    reported on this matter and, without examining the grounds for the appeal,<pb n="25" facs="v1n1p25"/>denied it in consideration of the state of slavery in
                    which the appellants found themselves.</p>
                <p>This magistrate did not hide how distressing this situation was and how desirable
                    it was for slavery to be declared incompatible with such intimate family
                    relationships. He announced that, through his dispatch, the Attorney General
                    assured that a bill regarding this incompatibility would be proposed in the
                    session of the colonial council. However, he had not found a legal basis under
                    which the Court of Cassation could release young Jacquard from the state of
                    slavery in which he found himself.</p>
                <p><persName ref="#Parant">Mr. Parant</persName>, the Attorney General, concluded in
                    this direction, invoking the admission Jacquard had made during his
                    interrogation and the steps taken by his own mother to secure his
                    emancipation.</p>
                <p>The admission recorded in his interrogation amounted to this:</p>
                <q><p>My name is Cyprien, also known as Jacquard; I am sixteen years old, and belong
                        to the colored caste; I am a carpenter by profession; I belong to my mother,
                        with whom I live in <placeName ref="#Cay">Cayenne</placeName>, where I was
                        born.</p></q>
                <p>The court, in a ruling dated June 26, started from this point of fact and
                    declared that there was no need to examine the merits of the appeal.</p>
                <p>During its discussion of the case of the <emph>de facto</emph> freedman <persName ref="#Louisy">Louisy</persName>, this court had seemed to us to better
                    understand its high mission. </p>
                <p>It had judged that freedom is a right and that slavery should be confined within
                    the strict limits granted it by the law, and that one should not treat as a
                    slave someone who has de facto ceased to be one. Consequently, despite the
                    colonial ordinances that obliged de facto freedmen in risk of being declared and
                    sold as slaves for the benefit of the colonial domain, to produce their freedom
                    papers, the court, focusing only on the law and the fact of freedom, declared
                    Louisy’s appeal admissible.</p>
                <p>Was this not the occasion to render a similar ruling? Neither in Roman
                    legislation nor in the <bibl type="legal"><title ref="#CN">Code
                        Noir</title></bibl> (the edict of 1689) do we find consecrated such
                    immorality, by which a father or<pb n="26" facs="v1n1p26"/>mother can become,
                    arbitrarily, the property of their child. For, with such a doctrine, one would
                    be obliged to tolerate that they sell the authors of their days in the market
                    and receive the price. The Romans also abolished the ancient law that gave the
                    father the right of life and death over all members of his family.</p>
                <p>The Code Noir allows for several cases where freedom results as of right from a
                    status incompatible with slavery. This includes the case where a master has
                    appointed a slave as his executor or as a guardian for his children.</p>
                <p/>
                <p>How can one reconcile the status of being a son with that of being a slave to his
                    mother? A son, according to natural law and the civil code published in the
                    colonies, is bound by duties entirely different from those of a slave towards
                    his mother.</p>
                <p>The mother also has particular duties towards her child. If this child becomes
                    unable to provide for their subsistence, is she not obligated to nourish them?
                    And how could such a law not be above the unjust law of slavery?</p>
                <p>It is regrettable that the Court of Cassation left this important question
                    without resolution and only focused on the apparent fact. By judging in this
                    manner, did it not violate Article 7 of the 1832 ordinance, which ensures that
                    those who are de facto free have the benefit of an appeal in cassation?</p>
                <p>In declaring that he belonged to his mother, did not young Cyprien Jacquard
                    prove, by that fact alone, that he had no master, and that there existed between
                    him and his mother nothing but the natural and civic bond?</p>

                <head>TRAITS OF CRUELTY.</head>

                <p>It would be a lengthy story to recount the deeds of revolting cruelty that some
                    slave owners in our colonies inflict upon the unfortunate slaves. Every day,
                    torn by the whip of the overseer, deprived of their coarse sustenance, they
                    slowly perish in incessant torment; only greed and never humanity sometimes hold
                    back these <pb n="27" facs="v1n1p27"/>cruel masters who fear losing a venal
                    price with the death of a slave. But when the slave, crippled or old, can no
                    longer provide the same services, when his presumed profit on the plantation no
                    longer exceeds the expenses he incurs, oh, then! No consideration can hold them
                    back anymore, and just as one breaks an old, disabled piece of furniture, so do
                    they mercilessly cause to perish the man they tore from his family when he was
                    young.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, a whim, a resurgence of barbarity seizes a master, and no matter what
                    potential prejudice such atrocious satisfaction might possibly bring him, he has
                    a man, his peer, his equal, sacrificed. These acts of cold cruelty are so far
                    from our mores that we, born in the colonies, cannot comprehend them. Often, an
                    honorable skepticism guards us against the accounts of our correspondents. Would
                    to God that they were all false! We would be the first to proclaim them so, and
                    our hearts would not be burdened by painful impressions.</p>
                <p>Here are two new facts to record in the long list of crimes that makes up
                    colonial history. There we not only see a colonist committing a heinous murder,
                    but another ordering it to be carried out by his slaves, thus demoralizing these
                    unfortunate individuals who, at the risk of their lives, could not refuse the
                    orders they received.</p>
                <p>In <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>, un landowner in the
                        <placeName>commune of La Rivière Pilote</placeName>, apparently convinced
                    that he had reason to complain about his slave Gabriel, summoned six slaves from
                    his workshop on April 16 and ordered them to bring him Gabriel's head. The
                    slaves promised obedience.</p>
                <p>Gabriel, unofficially informed of his master's intentions, went to see him and
                    offered 3,535 francs for his redemption. The master replied that he would
                    consider it. Although this reply was nothing short of satisfactory, the
                    unfortunate Gabriel set about realizing his funds, and went to the market town
                    of Le Marin to sell his flour. As he was leaving, six negroes ambushed him,
                    drove him to the sugar mill, tied him to a calabash tree and killed him. One of
                    the executioners then went to the owner, who, having heard the story of the
                    murder, simply replied coldly: <q><emph>That is well</emph></q>.</p>
                <pb n="28" facs="v1n1p28"/>
                <p>However, the planter, having gone to the place where Gabriel's mutilated corpse
                    lay, couldn't stand the dreadful sight for long: he withdrew, and with the help
                    of his sugar maker, spread the rumor that Gabriel had been killed by a mule. He
                    sent word to the Commune's Commissar, but public rumor had beaten him to it, and
                    the Commissar came with the Justice of the Peace and two doctors to perform an
                    autopsy on the corpse. The type of death was then recognized, and among other
                    wounds, a gunshot wound to the lower jaw. A report was drawn up and deposited at
                        <placeName ref="#FoR">Fort-Royal</placeName>.</p>
                <p>In the same colony, in the commune of <placeName>Macouba</placeName>, a wealthy
                    owner was accused by the public of killing his slaves. The public prosecutor
                    went to the property and found an unfortunate woman lying lifeless. The master
                    had cruelly castigated her, and she had expired under the lashes. To ascertain
                    whether the corpse was still alive, the cruel master went so far as to pierce
                    his victim's belly with a hot iron. The courts are investigating the case, but
                    the colonist accused of the crime is on the run. The new governor, <persName ref="#EH">Mr. Halgan</persName>, has hastened to send details of this act of
                    colonial monstrosity to the Ministry of the Navy.</p>
                <p>It is to be hoped that, in the interests of justice and humanity, such crimes
                    will not go unpunished. The honor of the government and the salvation of the
                    colony are at stake; for where the reign of justice ceases, the right of might
                    and violence is born. </p>

                <head>CONVOCATION OF THE CHAMBERS.</head>

                <p>The following ordinance is published in the <bibl type="periodical"><title ref="#MU">Moniteur</title></bibl> of <date>July 1</date>, dated
                        <date>June 30</date> and countersigned by <persName ref="#THI">Mr.
                        Thiers</persName> : </p>
                <q><p>Art. 1. The provision of our ordinance of May 25 of this year, which convened
                        the Chamber of Peers and the Chamber of Deputies for August 20, 1834, is
                            revoked.<pb n="29" facs="v1n1p29"/>Art. 2. The Chamber of Peers and the
                        Chamber of Deputies are convened for the next July 31.</p></q>
                <p>The <title ref="#MU"><emph>Moniteur</emph></title> publishes immediately after, but in the
                    non-official section, the following communication which explains the
                    significance of this measure:</p>
                <q><p>The meeting of the chambers was scheduled for August 20th next. It is now
                        brought forward and set, by this day's ordinance, to July 31st. The king,
                        who in August will be traveling to the southern provinces he has not yet
                        visited, did not want to be absent at the time of the chambers' assembly.
                        Furthermore, this assembly does not have its usual importance: it is
                        convened for the execution of Article 42 of the Charter. However, the
                        government cannot and should not commence their work at that time; no bills,
                        no budget proposals could be ready. Besides, our parliamentary traditions
                        fix the period for the chambers' work between the months of December and
                        May, during the winter season. To begin them in the middle of summer would
                        be an unfortunate departure from established customs. Three hundred deputies
                        from the former chamber, now part of the new one, have already spent five
                        months in Paris this year and could hardly return in July. It is, therefore,
                        appropriate to postpone the work to the customary time. Consequently, after
                        convening the chambers on July 31 and having them in session, the king,
                        using the right of prorogation, will prorogue them until the end of the year
                        to begin the important work of the new legislature at that time.</p></q>
                <p>Proroguing the chambers before they are constituted would be another outrage to
                    add to all those we witness daily. The chambers cannot be prorogued before the
                    new powers of the deputies are verified. If this violation of the Charter were
                    to occur, we will return to this subject.</p>

                <p>We believe it is necessary to inform about the election to the new legislature of
                    deputies who have always taken a particular interest in colonial issues.</p>
                <p><persName ref="#AD">Mr. DELABORDE</persName> was elected both in
                        <placeName ref="#Par">Paris</placeName> and <placeName>Étampes (Seine-et<pb n="30" facs="v1n1p30"/>Oise)</placeName>. Undoubtedly, one might wish for a bit
                    more severity from this honorable deputy toward the advisors to the crown.
                    Nevertheless, we will never hesitate to acknowledge Mr. Delaborde's pure
                    intentions, and we are confident that the cause of people of color will always
                    find support and protection in him.</p>
                <p><persName ref="#TRA">Mr. DE TRACY</persName> was elected in two electoral
                    districts in Allier. This choice honors the constituents even more than the
                    representative. Mr. de Tracy is the advocate of all noble causes and, in that
                    capacity, the most genuine and eloquent voice for the oppressed in our
                    colonies.</p>
                <p><persName ref="#FI">Mr. ISAMBERT</persName> was reelected in <placeName>Vendée
                        Luçon</placeName>. We congratulate the voters of Luçon for renewing the
                    mandate of the courageous defender of the deportees from <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>, a man as upright as he is enlightened, who never
                    lets an injustice pass without denouncing it and who has never failed the sacred
                    cause of humanity.</p>
                <p><persName ref="#GdL">Mr. GAETAN DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD</persName> was elected in the
                    department of Cher. We can only applaud this choice, which sends one of the most
                    zealous champions of the abolition of slavery back to the chamber.</p>
                <p>Among the most regrettable losses for people of color in the recent elections, we
                    must first mention <persName ref="#ES">Mr. Eusèbe Salverte</persName>.</p>
                <p>In the <placeName>5th electoral district of Paris</placeName>, <persName ref="#THI">Mr. Thiers </persName> defeated this honorable citizen. It is the
                    victory of intrigue over patriotic austerity personified in the person of Mr.
                    Salverte. Mr. the Minister of the Interior is the pale reflection of <persName ref="#Talle">Mr. de Talleyrand</persName>, that archetype and patriarch of
                    political roués, just as Mr. Salverte offers us the pure and living image of the

                <p>Messrs. <persName ref="#Chara">Charamaule</persName> and <persName ref="#Meril">Mérilhou</persName> were also not re-elected. Let us hope that the
                    re-elections that will take place due to double nominations will rectify this
                    loss or, rather, this injustice.</p>

                <q><p>The following article, published by the <bibl type="periodical"><title ref="#MU">Moniteur</title></bibl> of <date>July 2</date>, is
                        undoubtedly an indirect response to the new information provided about the
                        state of the colony of <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>In a letter dated May 21st, <persName ref="#EH">Vice-Admiral Halgan, Governor
                            of Martinique</persName>, reported to the Minister of the Navy on a tour
                        he had just made to several communes of the colony.</p>
                    <p>The following passages are noteworthy in this report: </p>
                    <q>
                        <p>I am happy to report that the population is perfectly calm in all the
                            areas I visited, and everyone is focused on taking advantage of a
                            favorable year for the harvest.</p>
                        <p>I conducted a thorough examination of the internal management of the
                            plantations and the treatment the slaves receive from their masters. The
                            administration generally seemed to me paternal and wise. Punishments are
                            falling into disuse, and on most of the properties where I stopped, I
                            observed that the masters had affection for their slaves who, without
                            concern for the future, are content with the present, attached to their
                            homes, the small comfort they enjoy, and willingly engage in work that
                            does not exceed their physical capabilities.</p>
                    </q>
                    <p>Thus, Vice-Admiral Halgan's testimony regarding the situation of the slaves
                        in Martinique is very similar to that of <persName ref="#JHD">Rear-Admiral
                            Dupotet</persName>, whom he replaced, and who himself had merely
                        confirmed the reports of his predecessor on this matter. This unanimity of
                        opinions from individuals holding high positions and who were well-placed to
                        know the truth seems to us of a nature to dispel many unjust prejudices and
                        convince that the lot of the slaves in French colonies today leaves little
                        to be desired for friends of humanity.</p>
                    <p>Would it not be permissible to point out that this unanimity among the
                        governors might only prove one thing, namely, that they have been, since
                        their arrival,<pb n="32" facs="v1n1p32"/>influenced by the same factors? And
                        as for Mr. Halgan in particular, who has barely arrived on the island, who
                        has seen but a few plantations, and who dismisses the pleas presented to
                        him, he is an authority that can, at this point, be challenged.</p></q>
                <p>(<emph>Messager</emph>.)</p>
                <p>If one is to believe the official newspaper, wouldn't the slaves be in a real
                        <emph>el dorado</emph>, enjoying the tranquil and pure happiness that is
                    only found in the shepherds' tales of Durfé and Florian? One must truly lack
                    shame to advance such obviously false claims. Let the
                            <title ref="#MU"><emph>Moniteur</emph></title> then provide us with
                        <persName>Admiral Halgan</persName>, report without reservations, and let it
                    tell us whether the masters mentioned by the admiral as having murdered slaves
                    are cherished by those who have witnessed the mutilation of their brothers. We
                    call for the <emph>complete and unaltered report</emph>, but they dare not
                    present it in its entirety, for it would suffice to reveal the extent of the
                    slaves' happiness. In an upcoming issue, we will examine this report and address
                    the <title ref="#MU"><emph>Moniteur</emph></title>'s deliberate omissions.</p>

                        men of color is a consequence of the exaggerated elevation of the electoral

                <p>The magistrates who are to compose the assize court in the Grand'Anse case are:
                        <persName ref="#PER">Mr. Perrinelle</persName>, <persName ref="#RL">RICHARD-LUCY</persName> and <persName ref="#LePell">Mr. Le
                        Pelletier-Duclary</persName>. Certainly, to transform innocent individuals
                    into guilty ones, one could not have chosen better than these eternal judges
                    under all regimes.</p>
                <p>Mr. Perrinelle, in the infamous 1824 trial, was one of the three judges out of
                    twelve who voted for the death penalty. RICHARD LUCY, the prosecutor-general at
                    that time, carried out the judgment that sentenced them to perpetual hard labor
                    and branding, in disregard of the appeal to cassation by the condemned. Mr. Le
                    Pelletier-Duclary, a troubled mind, presided, requesting the application of the
                    penalty dictated by his colleague RICHARD-LUCY.</p>
                <p>If one still needs further proof of the morality of this case, suffice it to name
                    the two colonial counselors, Messrs. <persName ref="#JorLa">MM. Jorna
                        Lacalle</persName> and <persName ref="#ABour">Alphonse Bourke</persName>,
                    who rendered the order<pb n="34" facs="v1n1p34"/>for the trial before the
                    assizes. Mr. Jorna Lacalle voted for the death penalty in the 1824 case. This
                    magistrate is utterly incompetent. Mr. Alphonse Bourke never completed his law
                    degree, but in the 1824 trial, he voted for the penalty of perpetual hard labor,
                    and as a conscientious judge, he personally ensured the execution of the
                    judgment to which he had contributed. His victims, bound to the stake, could
                    easily see him from one of the windows of the house of his godmother, Mme
                    Duclésemur, where he was stationed.</p>
                <p>-On May 19th, the drawing of lots was carried out for the four assessors who will
                    sit on the assize court. They are: Messrs. <persName ref="#Baud">Baudin</persName>, <persName ref="#HuyD">Huygues-Despointes</persName>,
                        <persName ref="#DuDu">Duval-Dugué</persName> (of Grand'Anse) and <persName ref="#Germa">Germa</persName>. Mr. Duval-Dagué is a complainant and a key
                    witness in the case he is called to judge. The indictment states, on page 39,
                    that two of the accused looted rum on his plantation. The accused were unable to
                    have him recused because Messrs. <persName ref="#AuA"><orig>Aubert-Armard</orig><corr>Aubert-Armand</corr></persName>, the
                    public prosecutor, and <persName>Selles</persName>, the royal judge, did not
                    find any incompatibility in a white man judging blacks and mulattos while being
                    a complainant and a witness.<emph>The respective character of Assessor
                        Duval-Dugué and the accused precludes any idea of recrimination between
                        them...</emph></p>
                <p>-When the accused from Grand'Anse were transferred from the prison to the
                    courthouse for the drawing of lots for the assessors, an extraordinary
                    deployment of troops took place; sentinels placed every ten paces prevented any
                    gathering. Leading were Messrs. <persName ref="#LTelem">Léonce</persName> and
                        <persName ref="#ATelem">Arthur Télémaque</persName>, handcuffed like all
                    their co-accused. An escort of eighty gendarmes was formed, and two companies of
                    riflemen brought up the rear.</p>
                <p>-<persName><orig>Mr. Armand Aubert</orig><corr>M.
                    Aubert-Armand</corr></persName>, the public prosecutor in Saint-Pierre, no doubt
                    wanting to show his bias towards men of color, pursues them with a series of
                    petty and miserable harassments, certain signs of a narrow and petty mind. This
                    magistrate pushes the limits of propriety to the point of refusing the titles of
                        <emph>Mr.</emph> and <emph>Mrs.</emph> to the relatives of the defendants in
                    the Grand'Anse case who requested from him permission to see the unfortunate
                    prisoners. It seems that the colonial atmosphere has a powerful effect on
                    Europeans predisposed to vanity, as they quickly adopt such ridiculous and silly
                    attitudes.</p>
                <pb n="35" facs="v1n1p35"/>
                <p>Shortly after the July Revolution, this same magistrate, appointed royal judge in
                        <placeName ref="#Cay">Cayenne</placeName>, did not hesitate to seek advice
                    from one of the representatives of people of color in <placeName ref="#Par">Paris</placeName>. He wanted, he said, to enlighten himself in order to
                    enforce the laws despite the ill will of the colonists. At that time, it is
                    true, he often met this representative in the salons of the Minister of Justice,
                    where he was received. This explains many things.</p>

                <p>The political situation remains the same; however, there is more tranquility,
                    which probably results less from the satisfaction of the parties than from the
                    weariness they feel from these continuous and fruitless clashes. There has been,
                    therefore, a sort of truce during which young white and colored people have come
                    closer, shaken hands, and mutually promised to live as brothers from now on. May
                    this commitment endure!</p>
                <p>The colonial council has not formulated a single decree; it has, until now, only
                    engaged in opposition to the proposed improvements. Thus, the government,
                    foreseeing that it will be overwhelmed sooner or later by this new institution,
                    is not very pleased with it.</p>
                <p>The consolidation of the National Guard remains a question; the council has not
                    yet made any decisions on this matter.</p>

                <p>The situation in this colony is beginning to feel the effects of some
                    improvements made to the colonial system since the July Revolution. Caste
                    prejudices are decreasing and will eventually disappear as institutions receive
                    further development.</p>
                <p>There is hope that in the upcoming elections, people of color will be appointed
                    to the general council. Already, a large number of votes are assured in favor of
                        <persName ref="#LEl">Mr. Louis Elie</persName>, who enjoys great respect in
                    the country.</p>
                <p>There is some activity in the organization of militias, and, in general, there is
                    no reason to complain about local authorities. As for trade, it is virtually
                    non-existent, and prospects for the future are quite bleak. <pb n="36" facs="v1n1p36"/> The re-election of <persName ref="#SUB">Mr.
                        Sully-Brunet</persName>, as a delegate, which seemed doubtful, now appears
                    to be assured.</p>

                <p>This important possession, whose colonization we hope not to be delayed much
                    longer, is beginning to enjoy some advantages - the inevitable results of its
                    geographical position and the fertile land that extends from the sea to the
                    foothills of the Atlas Mountains. The cessation of hostilities by the indigenous
                    people, renewed confidence, and more active commercial transactions are the
                    first outcomes of a fairer administration; indeed, justice is the primary good
                    for any people, even the barbarians themselves sacrifice at its altars. So what
                    benefits will France gain from this beautiful colony if the government manages
                    it with the broad and philanthropic principles that alone can foster unity
                    between the conquered and the conqueror!</p>

                    than armies, his conciliatory and wise words make us new allies or strengthen
                    the peaceful disposition of those we have acquired.</p>
                <p><persName ref="#BZ">Ben-Zegri</persName>, a defector from Constantine, and the
                    Jew Narboni, schemers who played a significant role during previous

                    managed to retain under all regimes. Upon hearing this news, the Atlas Mountains
                    Arabs have shown willingness to draw closer to us, which they did not do
                    previously.</p>
                <p>So, France should hasten to organize this beautiful colony, and above all, not
                    forget this great principle: the art of governing is not the art of
                    oppression.</p>

                <p>If the colonial aristocracy contented itself with persecuting the men of color
                    they deem dangerous, they would only partly fulfill their mission; they must
                    also pursue, even in foreign lands, the unfortunate individuals who have
                    incurred their animosity. Aristocratic <pb n="37" facs="v1n1p37"/>hatreds are as
                    tenacious as those of kings, and just as <persName ref="#NIC">Nicnolas</persName> pursues the remnants of Poland worldwide, or <persName ref="#C-A">Charles-Albert</persName> claims his victims everywhere, colonial
                    aristocracy also roars with fury when an unfortunate soul condemned to the
                    executioner manages to escape it. Their minions track down such individuals
                    everywhere, and if treaties, which they can render as flexible as laws, provide
                    a means, extradition satisfies their thirst for mulatto blood and their
                    obsession with punishment.</p>
                <p>After the events of the Grand'Anse, a man of color, <persName ref="#AHav">Mr.
                        Auguste Havre</persName>, took refuge on the Danish island of <placeName ref="#StT">Saint-Thomas</placeName>, espérant y trouver un asile où ses
                    persécuteurs ne viendraient pas le troubler. Son erreur était grande !
                        <persName>Mr. Morin</persName>, the son of a pharmacist from <placeName ref="#StP">Saint-Pierre</placeName>, went to Saint Thomas, recognized him,
                    and this young colonist reported him as a supporter of the Grand'Anse revolution
                    to <persName ref="#MACK">Admiral Mackau</persName>, Admiral Mackau, the
                    commander of the Antilles station, who happened to be in that Danish colony at
                    the time. This admiral who, for good reasons, shares colonial prejudices,
                    requested the extradition of Mr. Auguste Havre in order to hand him over to the
                    authorities in Martinique. He may well obtain it from the Danish government
                    which, despite its usual gentleness, may be influenced by the fear of
                    displeasing the French Ministry of the Navy.</p>
                <p>However, one must hope that the Saint Thomas government will be dignified enough
                    not to sacrifice the peace and lives of the unfortunate individuals who come to
                    its shores to the demands of a faction. Where would we be if the sacred laws of
                    hospitality could be violated with impunity?</p>

                <p>Before his departure from <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>, former
                    Governor <persName ref="#JHD">Dupotet</persName> solicited the extradition of
                    several of the accused in the Grand'Anse conspiracy who had taken refuge on the
                    island of <placeName ref="#STL">Saint-Lucia</placeName> offering to exchange
                    these unfortunate individuals for several escaped slaves from Saint Lucia. The
                    English governor responded with dignity, stating that he did not accept the
                    proposition and that he could not do so without the consent of his government.
                    He believed too highly in the British ministry to entertain the notion that they
                    would support such a dishonest action. Shortly <pb n="38" facs="v1n1p38"/>after,
                    when this governor had passed away, Mr. Dupotet did not hesitate to repeat his
                    request with his successor. Such measures can only be conceived by minds
                    accustomed to sycophantic servility, which, likening humans to properties,
                    believe that governments can trade, sell, or barter them at their whim. However,
                    nothing here should be surprising; it is known that Admiral Dupotet, like all
                    the minor colonial despots in charge of exploiting the colonies, is united in
                    heart, affection, and interest with the privileged class in these regions.</p>

                    that they no longer exist since people of color hold public office just like
                    whites, without any rivalry between them except that of merit. It's not
                    surprising, therefore, that this hospitable island, which is also adjacent to
                        <placeName ref="#MQ">Martinique</placeName>, Martinique, is a refuge for our
                    unfortunate compatriots who are persecuted. Well, General <persName ref="#JHD">Dupotet</persName>, former governor of Martinique, has also made an offer
                    to the governor of this colony for a deal in human flesh. Like his counterpart
                    in <placeName ref="#STL">Saint-Lucia</placeName>, the latter has categorically
                    refused. Honorable people can be found everywhere.</p>

                <head><persName ref="#LaF">THE GENERAL LAFAYETTE</persName></head>

                <p>Among the defenders of humanity, the most steadfast, unquestionably the most
                    virtuous, and the most dedicated was <persName ref="#LaF">Lafayette</persName>.
                    He is no more! He passed away on May 20th from an illness he contracted while
                    attending the funeral procession of the unfortunate Dulong. Despite experiencing
                    some signs of illness himself, the old general insisted on being present and
                    followed him devoutly, on foot, from the mortuary house to the grave prepared to
                    receive the mortal remains of <pb n="39" facs="v1n1p39"/>our dear friend. The
                    death of Dulong hastened Lafayette's own demise. For those of us who loved the
                    young deputy and had the privilege of closely observing the admirable old age of
                    the illustrious friend of <persName ref="#WAS">Washington</persName>, this was a
                    double source of sorrow.</p>
                <p>The name of Lafayette will live as long as the selflessness of personal interests
                    and pure, unwavering devotion to the cause of all are honored among men. Born
                    into one of the oldest families in France and recently married to Madame de
                    Noailles, a sudden transformation occurred in the excellent nature of this young
                    French nobleman that permanently converted him to the democratic cause. It was
                    like a revelation from above that determined the course of his life. He was but
                    seeking a field where he could worthily employ his noble faculties when news of
                    the American insurrection arrived in Europe. The young husband of Madame de
                    Noailles, the dashing cavalier whose grace and elegant manners were praised at
                    Versailles, had hardly read the American Declaration of Independence before he
                    was won over. Reading the Bill of Rights turned Mr. de Lafayette into what we
                    have seen him become: an indefatigable advocate for the oppressed, without
                    regard to nationality or color, and the most sincere and ardent proponent of
                    universal freedom.</p>
                <p>The intrepid volunteer arrived with incredible joy on the soil where he was about
                    to shed his blood, where <persName ref="#JEF">Jefferson</persName>, <persName ref="#ADA"><orig>Adam</orig><corr>Adams</corr></persName> and <persName ref="#WAS">Washington</persName> awaited him, and he only returned after
                    ensuring, along with his illustrious friends, through the surrender at Yorktown
                    that ended the War of Independence in October 1781, the national existence of
                    the great and serene republic that was always the object of his strong and
                    patriotic affection.</p>
                <p>The political life of Mr. Lafayette is well-known: the generous role he played in
                    the 1789 revolution, the strength of his logic, the simple clarity, and the
                    unwavering faith with which he advocated, in the <orgName ref="#AN">National
                        Assembly</orgName> and the <orgName ref="#AC">Constituent
                    Assembly</orgName>, the sacred principles for which we fight, do not need to be
                    reiterated. More than once, he raised his voice against the enslavement of black
                    people and the injustice that excluded people of color from the exercise of
                    their civic rights, but unfortunately, often without success.</p>
                <p>In this regard, he did not limit himself to theory; he also added practice, a
                    rarer thing: starting in 1791, the General emancipated all the <pb n="40" facs="v1n1p40"/>slaves in his possessions in <placeName ref="#GF">French
                        Guiana</placeName>. And on this account, he should be particularly dear to
                    black people and people of color, for whom he never ceased to demand freedom and
                    all the privileges of white citizens.</p>
                <p>In that same year, <date>1791</date>, he spoke these memorable words from the
                    podium: <q>According to the decrees of the National Assembly, I believe it is
                        clear that free <emph>men</emph>, property owners, cultivators, and
                        taxpayers are <emph>citizens</emph>. Now, men of color are property owners,
                        cultivators, taxpayers; are they <emph>men</emph>? </q>(Barely restrained
                    applause. He continued with the subtle irony that was familiar to him): <q>For
                        my part, I believe they are; and it is to express my opinion that I have
                        requested the floor.</q>At this point, the audience could no longer contain
                    themselves, and applause and cheers drowned out the speaker's voice.</p>
                <p>In the committee that was tasked, after the July Revolution, with examining a
                    bill on the same issue, and which only produced the imperfect law that governs
                    us, he displayed the greatest zeal for the extension of political rights for men
                    of color. However, the stubbornness and narrow prejudices of his colleagues
                    paralyzed his goodwill.</p>
                <p>Throughout his long career, concerning general politics, Mr. Lafayette made
                    mistakes on occasion; in particular, he allowed himself to be deceived. We
                    regret that he let slip, for the good of mankind, the few beautiful
                    opportunities that presented themselves to him to settle everything according to
                    his principles in the affairs of France and consequently in those of the entire
                    world. But, despite all, it must be acknowledged that no man has, with a more
                    noble character, followed a more honorable and upright course of conduct, even
                    in the face of some apparent contradictions. Perhaps Lafayette alone, among
                    historical figures, has managed to give practical and positive reality to what
                    is meant by the sacred word <q>virtue</q>.</p>
