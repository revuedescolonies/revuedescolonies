                    <p>There is a <bibl><title ref="#RC">Revue Coloniale</title></bibl> which differs from the <bibl><title ref="#RdC">Revue des Colonies</title></bibl>, not only in its title, but in its principles and the purpose of its publication. In mentioning this opposition; we do not mean to blame our adversaries. Everyone is perfectly free to write for or against the spirit of reform; but the following letter, which is addressed to us by one of the century’s greatest literary figures, compels us to acknowledge that an opinion contrary to ours publishes this <title ref="#RC">Revue Coloniale</title>, and that this Review has cited <persName ref="#ADp">M. Alexandre Dumas</persName> among its collaborators.</p>

                                <p>“Would you mind correcting in one of your next issues an error which I see committed in my regard on the cover of the <title ref="#RC">Revue Coloniale</title>; they announce that they will be publishing poems by me in one of their upcoming issues. First of all, I write little poetry, except for the theater; and I did not promise anything to the <title ref="#RC">Revue Coloniale</title>, which did not ask me for anything. All my sympathies, on the contrary, are instinctively and nationally for the adversaries of the principles defended by the Gentlemen of the <title ref="#RC">Revue Coloniale</title>; this is what I wish to be made perfectly clear, not only in France, but wherever I have brothers in race and friends of color.<ptr target="#mock1"/></p>
