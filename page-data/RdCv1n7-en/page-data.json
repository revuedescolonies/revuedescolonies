Nothing of all this has been, even for an instant, to be feared: far from it; innumerable documents which have been addressed to us from the very places themselves bear witness, in a manner not to be gainsaid, that free labour has already borne the happiest fruits in the <tei-placeName ref=\"#CA\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">English colonies</tei-placeName>.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    If it be necessary, nevertheless, to show once more to the incredulous in our colonies all that culture and industry have to gain by being practised only by free hands, we can easily invoke the testimony of all who have conscientiously examined the question; and assuredly proofs and arguments will not fail us!\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Let us attempt this useful examination.

Every man who is not remunerated in proportion to his labour will labour as little as possible; it is perhaps a rule without exception. Let a free workman be hired by the day, he will do little; but pay him by the piece, and often he will work with such ardour that his health will suffer. If this observation is true of the free producer, how much more must it be so of the slave producer.\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n      The superiority of free labourers, even over serfs, is\n      <tei-pb n=\"5\" facs=\"v1n7f5\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n      everywhere attested by their masters, when they are intelligent enough to appreciate the difference and conscientious enough to confess it. One must consult on this point a passage of <tei-persName ref=\"#Col\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Columella</tei-persName>, where he relates unheard-of traits of the perversity and negligence of slave labourers, and where he lays down as an incontestable principle that, whatever the nature of the labour, free production is always superior to that which is not free.\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n      And it is very remarkable that testimony so positive in favour of my thesis, continues <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Storch</tei-persName>, comes from Roman writers, who themselves possessed slaves and lands, and who consequently were very well placed to judge of the state of agriculture.\n      <tei-ptr target=\"\" n=\"6\" data-origname=\"ptr\" data-origatts=\"n target\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n      Assuredly it was not a philanthropic sentiment which made them hold such language; for we know how little respect, in general, the finest geniuses of antiquity had for the rights and dignity of the human race.\n      <tei-ptr target=\"\" n=\"7\" data-origname=\"ptr\" data-origatts=\"n target\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n      In manufacturing industry, the superiority of free labour is still more incontestable. As manufactures extend in Russia, occasions of convincing oneself of this truth are multiplied. In 1805, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Panteleyef</tei-persName>, a manufacturer at Moscow, emancipated himself all his serf workmen, to the number of eighty-four, and in the same year <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Milioutin</tei-persName> imitated this generous example.\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Brougham</tei-persName>, in his\n    <tei-bibl type=\"monogr\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\">\n      <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Colonial Policy</tei-title>\n    </tei-bibl>\n    , adopts the same theory:\n    <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n      If the labourer is a slave, says he, the only motive which can act upon him is fear. He must therefore be constantly watched. Pain and blows alone can prevent him from being idle. But this power of the whip is limited by its nature. By this odious means you may compel the slave to bestir himself, to act, because there is a marked difference between absolute repose and bodily exertion; but no chastisement, no punishment, can compel an unhappy workman to be always skilful, vigilant, attentive. Besides, when the body suffers, the mind is no more fit to command than the body itself is fit to obey. Severe chastisements soon bring despair in their train, and the repetition of the same cruelties ends by engendering a physical insensibility which renders the severity of punishments vain.\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Hume</tei-persName>\n    makes on this subject the following remark:\n    <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n      I must add, from the experience of our planters, that slavery is as\n      <tei-pb n=\"6\" facs=\"v1n7f6\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n      injurious to the master as to the slave.

It is necessary that the possibility of making a fortune should depend upon the individual, and it is only thus that the social state improves and tends towards perfection. This indisputable truth is still clearer to all who have had occasion to see for themselves the manner in which the labour of slaves is performed. The indifference of this class of labourers, their heedlessness, the extreme apathy of their movements, prove in a peremptory manner that they take no interest in their work. I myself had occasion to observe, on the same plantation, two bands of labourers, one of slaves, the other of free men, a mixture sufficiently rare; I was struck by the difference of their labour: the free labourers sang while they worked, their movements were quick and animated; but the poor slaves fulfilled their task in a dull silence, and their movements, seen from a little distance, were scarcely perceptible.\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Every one knows that in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Hindustan</tei-placeName> sugar of superior quality is manufactured at less expense than that of the <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANTE\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Antilles</tei-placeName>;\n    <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">China</tei-placeName>, <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Bengal</tei-placeName>, the coasts of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Malabar</tei-placeName> produce great quantities of sugars and spirits; but this kind of production prospers especially at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Batavia</tei-placeName>.

These slaves were either captives taken in war, or slaves bought. In the early times of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Athens</tei-placeName> and of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Rome</tei-placeName>, when the capital was surrounded by nations with which it was perpetually at war, the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">markets of men</tei-emph> were always abundantly supplied. The cruelty of the treatment inflicted on them was in direct proportion to the facility with which they could be procured; and history shows us how pitiable was their condition among those peoples who branded all foreigners with the name of barbarians. As wars became less frequent, and men devoted themselves more to the arts of peace, it was no longer so easy to obtain slaves; and at length, when the colossus of the Roman empire fell under its own weight, it became impossible to carry off slaves. A milder system of domestic government, a little more humanity towards the slaves that were possessed, and a little more care to perpetuate their race, were the necessary consequence of this state of things; for interest obliged the master to treat better slaves whom it was very difficult to replace. The laws ended by giving their sanction to a change which they had not provoked. It was recognized that slaves also had rights, and their emancipation was openly <tei-pb n=\"10\" facs=\"v1n7f10\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> encouraged; little by little, by imperceptible degrees, slaves were incorporated into the family of their masters, and formed the greater part of that enormous mass of free population with which the northern peoples mingled rather than subdued it.\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n      To the slavery of the ancients succeeded the serfage and the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">villainage</tei-emph> of the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Gothic nations</tei-placeName>; but these two kinds of servitude differ by very marked shades. The slaves of the <tei-placeName ref=\"#GR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Greeks</tei-placeName> and of the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Romans</tei-placeName> were an imported merchandise; whereas the slaves of the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Goths</tei-placeName> were born on the very soil which they occupied, save rare exceptions; in those first wars of conquest, barbarous victors sometimes dragged their prisoners after them. Thus there is no comparison to be made between the rigour of those two species of slavery. To this difference must be attributed the prodigious progress of civilization. The slave was first attached to his master, not as his personal property, but as <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">forming part of his estate</tei-emph>, according to the expression of feudal times. By degrees, the interests <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">of the lord and of the serfs</tei-emph> drew nearer and united; and by their mixture they brought about those immense changes from which resulted the formation of the bourgeoisie, which has since entirely renewed the face of Europe. Thus, by what degrees was that great revolution accomplished: first, the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">villain</tei-emph> obtained the faculty of cultivating the soil on his own account, subject to a certain due; that great and signal benefit, one of those which have secured the happiness of modern times, was effected after a long series of progressive improvements, the succession of which almost escapes the researches of the historian; and the human race is indebted for it to the discovery made by several possessors of serfs, of the advantage they could derive from the liberation of their slaves, under certain conditions. They believed that the interest of the slaves was identical with their own, and that it was of the highest importance for them to treat better in future those who made them live, and whom it was no longer possible to replace. They convinced themselves that it was far more advantageous to share with their vassals the fruit of an energetic and voluntary labour than to rob them shamefully of the sad product of a forced and servile industry. As soon as the right of property and the tranquil enjoyment of one’s labour were guaranteed to the serf, <tei-pb n=\"11\" facs=\"v1n7f11\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>civilization took a constant and progressive course. The peasants obtained the right to change their place and dispose of their savings. By degrees, rent was paid in money, and its price was fixed by competition; and those who could not obtain a farm to cultivate sold their labour for a determined wage. Finally, the laws assured to all farmers the liberty of their lease, as they guaranteed to the lord his rights over the leased land.\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n      There is a very singular analogy between the progressive improvement of Negroes in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">South America</tei-placeName>, and the enfranchisement of the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">villains</tei-emph> and of the serfs of <tei-placeName ref=\"#EUR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Europe</tei-placeName> in feudal times. For a long time gold and diamonds have been gathered in <tei-placeName ref=\"#BR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Brazil</tei-placeName> only by a mode of working altogether like that which feudal nobles had imagined to stimulate the activity of their peasants. The master furnishes the slaves with provisions and tools, and the slave is bound to furnish him a certain quantity of gold or precious stones in exchange. All that the slave can find beyond, belongs to himself. The gold mines of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Popayan</tei-placeName> and of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Choco</tei-placeName> have been worked under a similar system. The most productive fine-pearl fisheries of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">America</tei-placeName>, those of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Panama</tei-placeName>, are worked by slave <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">freeholders</tei-emph>, if one may so express it. In general, throughout the extent of that vast continent, Negroes were permitted to hire themselves out for labour, on condition of giving a certain sum to their masters.\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n      In these various countries, when a negro has succeeded in acquiring a little property, he seeks to buy his liberty. If the master obstinately insists on making him pay too dear for it, he can bring him before the courts, and often the master finds himself condemned to accept a reasonable price. This beneficent legislation has exercised the happiest influence in that part of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">America</tei-placeName>; the enfranchised blacks are there more numerous, more laborious, and more moral than elsewhere. A multitude of artisans have issued from this latter class, and entire regiments have been seen formed of blacks who had purchased their liberty with their own money. In several parts of South America, blacks are, in certain respects, in the position of the <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">coloni partiarii</tei-foreign>, or metayers of feudal times; but their <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">reddendo</tei-foreign> is fixed; all the surplus belongs to them, whereas a metayer shares all profits whatever with his master. This gradual softening of servitude, consisting in giving  <tei-pb n=\"12\" facs=\"v1n7f12\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>the slave the faculty of working on his own account, subject to a due, has been followed by the greatest advantages.\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Experience has proved that everywhere the emancipation of slaves or serfs increases the value of lands; here is what the traveller Coxe relates on this subject:\n    <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n      Several Polish lords, humane and enlightened, have tried to enfranchise their serfs; the event has shown that this measure, which does honour to their humanity, was of still greater advantage to them, for the enfranchised districts rapidly increased in population and tripled their revenues. The lord who first gave liberty to his serfs was <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Jamoiski</tei-persName>, former chancellor of the diet, who enfranchised six villages in the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">palatinate of Masovia</tei-placeName>. In examining the register of births from 1750 to 1760, during the ten years preceding enfranchisement, one finds four hundred and thirty-four births; and in the first ten years of liberty, from 1760 to 1770, five hundred and twenty-eight; and from 1770 to 1777, five hundred and eighty-five; whence it results that the proportional average of births in each year has been as follows:\n      <tei-table data-origname=\"table\">\n        <tei-row data-origname=\"row\">\n          <tei-cell data-origname=\"cell\">First period, (slavery)</tei-cell>\n          <tei-cell data-origname=\"cell\">43 births</tei-cell>\n        </tei-row>\n        <tei-row data-origname=\"row\">\n          <tei-cell data-origname=\"cell\">Second period, (liberty)</tei-cell>\n          <tei-cell data-origname=\"cell\">62 births</tei-cell>\n        </tei-row>\n        <tei-row data-origname=\"row\">\n          <tei-cell data-origname=\"cell\">Third period, (liberty)</tei-cell>\n          <tei-cell data-origname=\"cell\">77 births</tei-cell>\n        </tei-row>\n      </tei-table>\n    </tei-quote>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    It is the interest of masters also, sustained moreover energetically by philanthropic and Christian sentiments, which determined the abolition of slavery in the <tei-placeName ref=\"#CA\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">English colonies</tei-placeName>; it is that same interest which will bring about its abolition in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">our colonies</tei-placeName>.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANG\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">England</tei-placeName>, in the first rank of the nations of <tei-placeName ref=\"#EUR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Europe</tei-placeName>, such as the principles of modern civilization have made them, with their admirable industrial organization, their fair democracy of free labourers equal before the law, their factories, their workshops, their comfort in all things, launched with power into the indefinite career of perfectibility, bear high witness and sufficiently tell all what peoples can know and do when enfranchised from all servitude and all serfage, and what is their superiority over slave peoples, especially in the arts of peace.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Will it be said that such a future is a dream for us; that, whatever we do, it will be, for men of African race, the promised land toward which they will always aspire without ever reaching it?\n    <tei-pb n=\"13\" facs=\"v1n7f13\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n    Is it a culminating point beyond our reach, which will remain inaccessible to all our efforts?

But facts are there to give the lie to that pitiful assertion. The black race is inferior to the white race only because the latter has been admitted for centuries to the great banquet of civilization, where it has multiplied its forces a hundredfold by intelligence, while the other has always been carefully kept at a distance. Yet of itself the black race has known how to carve out a place by force and to create a country for itself where, a few years before, the drivers’ whip and the ignominious gaol were its only portion. But without even speaking of the republic of <tei-placeName ref=\"#HT\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Haiti</tei-placeName>, has not the black race presented numerous and great examples of sociability? The black regiments at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Halifax</tei-placeName>, the free labourers of <tei-placeName ref=\"#TRI\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Trinidad</tei-placeName>, long before there was even question of the emancipation <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">bill</tei-foreign>, the <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">west-indian black regiments</tei-foreign>, the black colonies of <tei-placeName ref=\"#SL\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Sierra Leone</tei-placeName>, the blacks of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Colombia</tei-placeName> enfranchised by <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Bolivar</tei-persName>, are not these peremptory and irrefragable answers to those who deny the proofs of the aptitude and intellectual worth of that race so despised by those who stifle its development in the sole interest of their momentary fortune? Facts therefore are here on the side of right and reason; and nothing is to-day more evidently demonstrated than this proposition, admirably supported in a <tei-bibl type=\"monogr\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Memoir on the Sociability of the Black Race</tei-title></tei-bibl>, inserted in volume V, p. 557, of the <tei-bibl type=\"periodical\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Journal of the Society for Christian Morality</tei-title></tei-bibl>, namely:\n    Whenever the despotism of the stronger has been willing to allow the black race to develop itself, it has developed itself as rapidly, in all respects, as the white race.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    If, then, Negro slaves are very bad labourers, it is because it is natural that they should be so; because, debased, despised, beaten, treated worse than beasts of burden, one single thing ought to astonish us on their part, namely, that they submit with so much long-suffering; that they do not more often show, with fire and iron in their hands, as at <tei-placeName ref=\"#HT\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Saint-Domingue</tei-placeName>, the fierce and cruel character <tei-pb n=\"14\" facs=\"v1n7f14\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> which long-endured oppression naturally stamps upon men; that, deprived of all moral notions and of truly religious instruction, they suffer without vengeance the evils and affronts of every kind with which they are daily overwhelmed.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Whatever one might say of the immorality, even of the ferocity, of Negro slaves, there is not a true philosopher who would be astonished by it; and if, even in slavery, blacks display, as it is true they do, admirable qualities and remarkable faculties, who can doubt of all they will be capable of once restored to liberty?\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Behold <tei-placeName ref=\"#HT\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Haiti</tei-placeName>, where instruction and the books of <tei-placeName ref=\"#EUR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Europe</tei-placeName> have fertilized the intelligence and moralized the heart of the multitude.

Proprietors and managers are far from concealing the executions which they order from time to time, and in which they cause from thirty to a hundred lashes, and even more, to be inflicted. One of these planters, wishing to rid himself of an old negress, had her slashed successively by three drivers, and then left her to end her days in a dungeon.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Does poison commit ravages upon an estate?

Instead of delivering them into the hands of justice with the indications of their guilt, the proprietor constitutes at home a sovereign tribunal, causes the suspected negro to be shut up in a cell; sentence is pronounced; he must die there of hunger or under blows. I have been assured that such examples were numerous. We read in the\n    <tei-bibl type=\"periodical\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Gazette des Tribunaux</tei-title></tei-bibl>\n    of 26 October 1831:\n    <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n      A commission of inquiry, of which <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Duquesne</tei-persName> was president, established in March last, in the quarter of <tei-placeName ref=\"#TRI\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">La Trinité</tei-placeName> <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">(Martinique)</tei-placeName>, horrible crimes.

During the meal, the governor, who was soon to depart for <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName>, proposed to sell him one of the negroes who served at table, an excellent domestic, whose precious qualities he extolled. My father, turning to that slave, asked him if he wished to serve him. His reputation for severity was so well established that the negro, who dreaded being sold to him, answered him frankly that no, and made a negative gesture. My father feigned not to have understood him, and told the governor that the bargain was concluded and that he would give him the price he desired. He carried the negro with him to <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName>. You declared that you did not wish to serve me, said he to him; I consent; you shall have nothing to do: here is your hut. By his order, a heavy chain was put upon his foot; then he was shut up in a small grated hovel, a kennel as it were, placed on the terrace adjoining the house. In vain did the wretch ask his pardon with tears in his eyes; in vain did he assure him that he would serve him as a faithful negro; my father was inexorable. That black lived thirty years in that den; and though during that long space my father passed a thousand times a day near that unfortunate man, though foreigners often took pity on his lot and implored the forgetting of his fault, never did he suffer himself to be moved.

We could show a thousand applications of this painful truth; but we are not here making the inventory of all those human miseries. One single fact must be cited by way of example; an immense fact, from which our philosophical observation issues with a frightful reality.\n    <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">The appeal of the condemned of Grand'Anse has been rejected!</tei-emph>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Thus, then, seven colonists of Martinique, united as a criminal tribunal, imbued with caste prejudices, have been able to put to death forty of their compatriots? They might have delivered to the executioner the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">one hundred and sixty heads</tei-emph> demanded by the attorney-general <tei-persName ref=\"#ANog\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Nogues</tei-persName>... And the metropolis would have approved all!\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    What then is that supreme court placed, like the keystone, at the summit of the judicial order, exercising sovereign power over courts and tribunals? Was it not instituted to quash bad judgments, to bring judges back to law, to reason, to humanity, judges ignorant or prevaricating? Above all those whom vertigos of blood agitate upon their bench, and who have erected into a principle of government human sacrifices, the punishment of a hundred heads, those <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">hecatombs</tei-emph> which the ancients offered to the gods in cattle, not in men.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Such indeed is the mission of the supreme court. But that high tribunal, placed outside the storms and passions of men, too often intervenes in their affairs only as a sort of phantom of justice, foreign to the sad realities of this world, unintelligent of the crimes of the earth, inclined to optimism, not readily seeing evil, because man, placed under certain conditions, loves to suppose good. Perhaps, O venerable magistrates! you did not understand so much perversity, so much insensibility to all that is holy and sacred. Perhaps you did not understand\n    <tei-pb n=\"20\" facs=\"v1n7f20\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n    so much Machiavellian cruelty in Frenchmen, in those, in fine, who, like you and beneath you, exercise the priesthood of justice. The Court of Cassation, created in 1790, is a great idea, great like all the ideas of that epoch; but it is perhaps a small institution functioning narrowly within the bonds of a petty and timorous organization. It knows only the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">form</tei-emph> and not the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">substance</tei-emph> of causes; it judges the judgment, not the trial; it judges, as a work of judicial logic, the intellectual operation of the lower tribunal which consists in applying the law to facts or to men; it does not judge it as a work of justice. There, all is reduced to mathematical exactitude; and if a man is killed <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">by demonstrative reasoning</tei-emph>, the judgment is good; it is maintained. One must even remark this strange and shocking anomaly, that the influence of the Court of Cassation upon the substance of causes is far greater in civil suits than in criminal suits. For the former, where there are only pecuniary and material interests at stake, it binds the judges of the merits by the power of reason and the authority of its doctrines on controverted questions which are often the whole cause. For the latter, on the contrary, where honour, liberty, the life of citizens are at stake, reduced to verifying the regularity of procedure and the exact application of the penalty, it has censure only for formalities; it has none for the condemnations in themselves, for those which would strike innocent men, for <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">verdicts</tei-emph> that would be <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">lies</tei-emph>, for judgments dictated by hatred or by the spirit of persecution, or by politics, that changeful queen of our times, which introduces into judgments all the mobility of passions and of systems.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Well then! in an island of the <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANTE\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Antilles</tei-placeName>, at <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, in the midst of a scanty population, for a purely political cause, forty accused have been condemned to capital punishment! Fifty-three others to forced labour, to perpetual deportation, etc.! A hundred families are stricken! An entire commune is depopulated! An entire French colony is terrified by the murderous action of this justice more than prévôtale! What matters it! The metropolis will do justice and make reparation; it will quash the abominable judgment denounced to the Court of Cassation by the condemned. No; let all the heads fall which the judgment has struck! The procès-verbal of the sittings of the assize court attests the minute accomplishment of all formalities. None is omitted, at least in the descriptive drafting of the procès-verbal. That suffices; the supreme court is powerless to revise the trial otherwise, and the appeal must be rejected.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-pb n=\"21\" facs=\"v1n7f21\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Thus, before the Court of Cassation, it was necessary to drag the greatest judicial monstrosity that has ever desolated the colonies over nullities of procedure.

We learn that in the departments the question of the abolition of slavery excites the liveliest interest, and that the fine example given by the citizens of <tei-placeName ref=\"#Par\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Paris</tei-placeName> will not be slow to be imitated.\n      <tei-pb n=\"22\" facs=\"v1n7f22\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-floatingText data-origname=\"floatingText\">\n      <tei-body data-origname=\"body\">\n        <tei-div data-origname=\"div\">\n          <tei-head n=\"Messieurs,\" data-origname=\"head\" data-origatts=\"n\">GENTLEMEN,</tei-head>\n\n          <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            Permit us to call your attention to the condition of the slaves of the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">French colonies</tei-placeName>. More than once the Chambers have expressed the compassion which these unhappy beings inspire in them, by referring to <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Mr. the Minister of Marine</tei-roleName> the petitions which have been addressed to them to claim their intervention in favour of the slaves; but nothing, absolutely nothing has been done to alleviate their sufferings; and, it must be said, nothing or almost nothing could be done, if one wished to stop in the path of improvements, and if one did not propose to arrive, by wisely progressive measures, at the cessation of slavery and the enfranchisement of the blacks. The colonists have felt that all is connected in the colonial system; they know that one concession contains the germ of another concession, and it is to avoid being carried along by an irresistible movement towards the great social change which they dread, that they have opposed the most absolute resistance to the efforts attempted by the friends of the blacks. The government has adopted their views, because it shared their fears, and it is on that account that we have seen introduced into the French colonies none of those measures by which the legislators of <tei-placeName ref=\"#GB\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Great Britain</tei-placeName> have prepared a new era for their colonies.\n          </tei-p>\n\n          <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANG\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">England</tei-placeName> has for many years favoured all that could increase the well-being of the slave population. In particular, if it has not encouraged, it has at least fully tolerated the religious instruction and the elementary instruction of the blacks; it has by a law obliged proprietors to enfranchise their slaves when these should offer them the amount of their value; finally it has established in its colonies protectors and guardians of the slaves, thus recognizing for them in advance certain rights, because it wished in the end to recognize for them all rights.\n          </tei-p>\n\n          <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName>, on the contrary, long regarding the emancipation of the blacks as a utopia, although the trial which she herself formerly attempted ought to have taught her that it is possible, has not wished to advance towards an end from which she believed herself separated by insurmountable <tei-pb n=\"23\" facs=\"v1n7f23\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/> obstacles. The relations of the metropolis with the colonies being limited to a small minority, interested moreover in keeping up the fears which the colonists have always sought to spread as to the consequences of enfranchisement, if ever one dared to attempt it, it has resulted that hitherto, among us, there have been only confused and erroneous ideas of their condition. Men have believed in real dangers, whereas there were only difficulties to be feared. The most impatient have thought it necessary to leave to a neighbouring nation, within which this question had had time to become popular, the perils and the glory of a hazardous initiative.\n          </tei-p>\n\n          <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            Well then, Gentlemen, that initiative has been taken. The great social fact which statesmen, belonging to contrary parties, demanded as a measure of wisdom, while Christians of all denominations called for it as an act of justice and humanity, is to-day accomplished in the colonies of <tei-placeName ref=\"#GB\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Great Britain</tei-placeName>. The class of slaves has ceased to exist, because a generous law has given it letters of freedom. To believe the adversaries of enfranchisement, the ships charged to transmit the news of the execution of the parliamentary <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">bill</tei-foreign> could not fail to bring also the recital of the most terrible excesses. The <tei-foreign data-origname=\"foreign\">bill</tei-foreign> would be, it was said, equivalent to a provocation to murder and to incendiarism; but those sinister previsions have not been realized. Far from refusing to work, and giving themselves up to the excesses represented as imminent, the blacks have, in general, given proofs of the desire they have to show themselves worthy of liberty by their activity and their spirit of subordination. In most of the colonies, they wished publicly to consecrate the day of their enfranchisement by prayers and thanksgivings. Each day consolidates the transformation which has been effected without resistance and without shock, and <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANG\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">England</tei-placeName> prepares for herself, in place of a wretched caste, within which servitude maintained a continual irritation, an intelligent and peaceful population.\n          </tei-p>\n\n          <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            After having left to others the care of making an experiment so happy in its results, would it be permitted to <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName> not to profit by it? No, Gentlemen; what was lately called an impossibility, a utopia, appears to-day as a necessity <tei-pb n=\"24\" facs=\"v1n7f24\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>near at hand. It cannot be, in fact, when there are no longer slaves in the <tei-placeName ref=\"#CA\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">English colonies</tei-placeName>, that there should remain slaves long still in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">our islands</tei-placeName>, situated in the same seas. In presence of the new order of things established in the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">British Antilles</tei-placeName>, the danger for us is no longer in abolition, it is in the maintenance of slavery. Besides, civilized nations touch too closely for great thoughts and generous ideas not to be rapidly communicated from one to another. What <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANG\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">England</tei-placeName> has willed and has been able to do, will not <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName> will it, will she not be able to do it? We love rather to believe that it is the will of the nation which will constitute above all the necessity we foresee; for how suppose that it will consent to tolerate in its codes the shameful page which another people has torn from the book of its laws? And to whom would it belong with more just title than to you, Gentlemen, to be the organs of the nation? Consent, then, to signalize the first session of the French Chambers held after the emancipation of the slaves of the English colonies by a solemn vote, which, in testifying that they are penetrated with the thought of a great duty, may serve as a guarantee for a great benefit!\n          </tei-p>\n\n          <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            We do not come to ask you, Gentlemen, to recommend to the government this measure rather than that; we do not say that those adopted successively by <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANG\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">England</tei-placeName> are the best, nor the only ones which it would be fitting to adopt; we do not pretend, in a word, to trace a plan for the enfranchisement of the blacks. What we desire only is that the Chambers, that the government, should avow the principle which we invoke; that they should recognize from this moment that it is necessary, no matter for the present by what road, to attain, in a time as short as possible, the great end of the complete abolition of slavery. If this project is avowed, the greatest advantages will result from that avowal itself. The colonists will labour, by facilitating the instruction of the slaves, to diminish the dangers which appear to them inseparable from emancipation, and they will prepare themselves from this moment, with a wise foresight, for the new order of things which shall have been announced to them. Legislators, instead of advancing upon shifting ground and being forced to make laws that partake of their uncertainties, will reconcile beforehand their legislative measures with that one which they will know must crown them all. The whole people, accustoming itself to attach thoughts of hope and glory to the realization of a plan which justice and humanity demand, will associate itself with it by its sympathies. The national conscience at last will be able to bear witness to itself that <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName> does not recoil before a duty, the evidence of which is demonstrated to her, but that she wills to accomplish it as soon as she has recognized its accomplishment possible.\n            <tei-pb n=\"25\" facs=\"v1n7f25\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n          </tei-p>\n\n          <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            We have the honour to be, etc.\n          </tei-p>\n\n          <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n            Paris, 17 December 1831.\n          </tei-p>\n\n          <tei-closer data-origname=\"closer\">(Here follow the signatures.)</tei-closer>\n        </tei-div>\n      </tei-body>\n    </tei-floatingText>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      We shall keep our readers informed of the discussions which this petition may raise within the two Chambers.\n    </tei-p>\n  </tei-div>\n</tei-div>\n<tei-div xml:id=\"coursBlanqui\" id=\"coursBlanqui\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"xml:id\">\n  <tei-head n=\"Cours d'économie industrielle au conservatoire des arts et métiers , par m. blanqui aine aîné .\" data-origname=\"head\" data-origatts=\"n\">\n    COURSE OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY AT THE <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">CONSERVATORY OF ARTS AND TRADES</tei-orgName>, BY MR. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">BLANQUI</tei-persName>, THE ELDER.\n  </tei-head>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    There are few public courses attended with as much favour, and drawing a greater number of hearers, than that which we are to notice to-day. A lively interest attaches to the questions of political economy, which must at least be elucidated, if the time for their immediate solution has not yet arrived; we shall not therefore speak of the professor’s remarkable talent, known by the services which, young as he still is, he has already rendered to science and to liberty, whether as a public writer, or as the head of the fine establishment which he directs, or, lastly, in his lectures at the Conservatory, where he fills the chair of his illustrious master, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">J. B. Say</tei-persName>.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Mr. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">BLANQUI</tei-persName> is an ardent antagonist of the prohibitive system; the war which he wages against commercial and industrial privileges was bound to lead him to the examination of our colonial régime, which he attacked in his lecture of the 26th of December with an indignation and a force of logic of which we could give only a faint idea.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    The legislation of sugars was first analysed by the professor, in all its phases since the Restoration of <tei-date data-origname=\"date\">1815</tei-date>; he followed it step by step, date by date, figure by figure, the <tei-bibl type=\"periodical\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\"><tei-title ref=\"#MU\" data-origname=\"title\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Moniteur</tei-title></tei-bibl> in hand, explaining the double duty and its effects upon home consumption, unfolding the infamous abuses to which the import premium gave birth, from the law of the 17th of May <tei-date data-origname=\"date\">1826</tei-date>, the date of the law, down to 1833. The scandals of that premium are well known, and the unanimous outcry of reprobation which it raised when Mr. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Gauthier</tei-persName> came to reveal from the tribune both the palpable dishonesty of the yield-calculations at the time when the law was voted, and the intolerable burdens which that premium imposed upon <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName>, compelled to pay the most iniquitous brigandage; since, as Mr. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Blanqui</tei-persName> has said, it is proved now that waggons loaded with sugar went out of the territory, then re-entered by another point of the frontier, to go out again and receive a new tribute.\n    <tei-pb n=\"26\" facs=\"v1n7f26\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    Never have the disastrous effects of the protective system been more visible than in the efforts attempted in favour of our colonies; far from re-establishing their affairs, protection has accelerated their decay; it stimulates the manufacture of native sugar, which, from day to day, assumes a threatening extension. The sugar estates in the colonies are encumbered; the interest paid by the planters is at an excessive rate: at <tei-placeName ref=\"#BrB\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Bourbon</tei-placeName> money is not lent under twelve per cent; at the <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName>, at the <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, at <tei-placeName ref=\"#Cay\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Cayenne</tei-placeName>, usury is truly frightful. The means of transport are excessively costly: from the plantation to the shore it often costs a sum equivalent to the freight from the colony to the metropolis.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    The illicit profits afforded by the export premium on refined sugars forced the colonies to produce at any price; this fever of production made men think far more of the quantity than of the economical means of manufacture. Unable to satisfy the demands of the refiners of the metropolis, the colonists secretly brought in sugars from <tei-placeName ref=\"#CUB\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Cuba</tei-placeName>, and shipped them to us without taking the trouble to disguise the form of the packages. <tei-placeName ref=\"#CUB\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Cuba</tei-placeName> supplies, at twenty centimes, and <tei-placeName ref=\"#BR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Brazil</tei-placeName> and <tei-placeName ref=\"#IN\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">India</tei-placeName> at fifteen centimes, sugars of a superior quality; and the improved processes of labour perfected throughout the <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANTE\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Antilles</tei-placeName> cannot penetrate into our islands, because we lack the capital indispensable for the first expenses which they require; and, to crown this distress, behold a political law, into which at last humane principles against the slave-trade have entered, comes to paralyze the fiscal law, already radically powerless. The one would fain encourage and protect the manufacture of sugar in our islands; the other deprives them of the instruments of labour without which they declare they cannot do. The most infamous of contrabands, that which is carried on in the sale of unhappy creatures made in the image of God, incessantly raises the price of negroes, who sell for 1,800 fr. to 2,000 fr. (1). Mortality makes terrible ravages among these unhappy beings; their number decreases so sensibly, and in such a proportion, that before thirty years all will be over. In 1825, on an estate of <tei-placeName ref=\"#BrB\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Bourbon</tei-placeName>, whose slaves are called the king’s negroes, 925 blacks gave birth to 37 children, and were struck by 65 deaths; in 1826, there were counted 2,475 deaths at the <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, against 1,499 births; the <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName> refused to give its figures; it hid its dead!

On this side of the Atlantic they cannot scourge us, but they disguise us as agitators, as tribunes, if we raise our voice in favour of truth; the most authentic facts are but vain declamations; the most incontestable principles are absurd theories; men attribute to us hateful sentiments which we have not, motives which we cannot have. The evil is prolonged to the great damage even of the colonists themselves; and the final result is, that in war time we have no longer colonies, and in peace time the dearness of their produce renders them burdensome beyond measure.\n  </tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n    We shall end this too imperfect analysis of a fine lecture by the literal quotation of two very remarkable passages read by Mr. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">BLANQUI</tei-persName> in support of his economic calculations and his exposition of colonial facts; the one belongs to Mr. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Ch.

Such a traffic on the part of an dishonest man would be natural, if the stolen goods were delivered at a much lower price than the current price of commerce; but if thieves, considering the dangers of their profession, demanded a higher price, what should we think of him who gave them the preference?

The schooner <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">the Charte</tei-emph>, <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">captain</tei-roleName> <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Coulin</tei-persName>, <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">owner</tei-roleName> <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">T.

The Charte remained two days in the roadstead after the embarkation of the said slaves; and during that time the two gendarmes were stationed on board her.

So soon as a slave displeases, the master has no other means of getting rid of him than to sell him to these new traffickers in human flesh, who carry them to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Porto Rico</tei-placeName> in coasting boats which no one takes the trouble to watch.

Three days ago a boat was to take ten, who were already shut up in the dungeons of an estate at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Rivière-Blanche</tei-placeName>; the manoeuvres of this coaster having roused the vigilance of a customs schooner, the boat could receive only three. Another was about to be embarked, who was found handcuffed in a pirogue, accompanied by his master; but, at sight of the vessel which was to tear him for ever from his native soil, cries of despair broke from him; a struggle ensues between master and slave; the frail pirogue, ill-ballasted, cannot withstand the shock, capsizes, and drags the unhappy handcuffed slave into the depths of the sea. Some maintain that they succeeded in saving him and putting him on board the vessel; others assure us that he was drowned. If I cannot, to-day, give you fuller information on this fact, it is because this wretched master, in concert with those who trafficked with him, has contrived to wrap his actions in a mysterious veil, which I may perhaps succeed in lifting.\n      </tei-quote>\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n        There is tumult and discord in the <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">colonial council</tei-orgName>, assembled since the 15th of October.

Happily, too, we have read that journal, which is not a common thing, and we have borrowed from it the interesting particulars which follow:\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      OPENING OF THE COLONIAL COUNCIL.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n        «Conformably to the proclamation of the 1st of October 1834, the members of the colonial council, present in the colony, were assembled a little before noon, in the hall appointed for the sittings...... etc.\n      </tei-quote>\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n        Mr. the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">governor</tei-roleName>, after having invited the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">councillors</tei-roleName> to take their seats, pronounced, seated and covered, the opening speech.»\n      </tei-quote>\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      We had hitherto known only constitutional kings who deemed it decent and becoming to come and communicate to the representatives of the nation their petty wills, their tender sentiments, their personal joys and satisfactions, their wants of money, and their vows for the prosperity of the country; and to deliver the monarchic rosary at their ease in a comfortable arm-chair, the hands resting on the thigh and an enormous hat upon the head. And what has not been said of that hat? Some maintained it was old and threadbare; others that his majesty wore it awry: these said it was a plumed hat, those a three-cornered hat, a two-cornered hat..... and so on. Such is the lot of the world. For our part, we shall not make so many reflections upon <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Halgan</tei-persName>'s hat; we shall simply say that the only thing which appeared to us worthy of remark in the hat was, that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Halgan</tei-persName> wore it upon his head.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-pb n=\"41\" facs=\"v1n7f41\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      One cannot too much admire here the power of great examples. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Halgan</tei-persName> said to himself: The politeness of kings consists in speaking with the hat on the head; I am here a little sovereign; therefore, when I go to communicate to the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">colonial councillors</tei-roleName> the ideas which I am supposed to have conceived for the public happiness, I must uncover my heart and cover my head. It seems to me that, if I had had the honour to be a colonial councillor, I should have said to <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Halgan</tei-persName> what <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Sganarelle</tei-emph> says to <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Géronte</tei-emph> in the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Médecin malgré lui</tei-emph>:\n      <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n        «Hippocrates says, Mr. <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Governor</tei-roleName>, that we should both keep our hats on.»\n      </tei-quote>\n      And if <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Halgan</tei-persName> had made the slightest observation, I should very quickly have referred him to the chapter on hats; but no: the colonial aristocracy is not so susceptible, at least as to things that come from above; it accepts the superiority of the chief on condition that it may itself make felt its own upon those whom the most miserable prejudice keeps as its inferiors. This pact of servitude makes up, more or less, the whole morality of society; and this is what we have seen admirably characterized in an old English caricature which represents the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">King</tei-roleName> of <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANG\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">England</tei-placeName> giving a kick to his <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">prime minister</tei-roleName>, who passes it on to a member of the <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">Commons</tei-orgName>, who passes it on to <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">John Bull</tei-persName>, who, for his part, passes it on to no one. We believe, therefore, that the <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">colonial council</tei-orgName> consoled itself for the kick, we mean for the hat-blow of Mr. the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Governor</tei-roleName>, by thinking it might very well return it to others.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Halgan</tei-persName> and his hat delivered a discourse in which we admired this passage:\n      <tei-q data-origname=\"q\">\n        «Tranquillity reigns in all parts of the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">colony</tei-placeName>: I shall devote my care to maintaining order there; the fidelity of the gangs, in difficult circumstances, their attachment to their masters, will be to-day, especially for the metropolis, guarantees of the system of moderation by which they are governed.»\n      </tei-q>\n      The fidelity of the gangs... Oh! oh! oh! there are no more slaves in <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName>. There are only workmen, such as we see every day, who labour in workshops! Admirable! What a revolution!\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-pb n=\"42\" facs=\"v1n7f42\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      Long live the <tei-bibl type=\"legal\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Charter</tei-title></tei-bibl>! Long live humanity! Our hearts as citizens have expanded at the sound of this official language. There were even some who were tempted already to envy the lot of those workmen who labour in the workshops of <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName>. Unhappily the <tei-bibl type=\"legal\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\"><tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Official Journal</tei-emph></tei-title></tei-bibl> contains a certain number of petitions for <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">manumission</tei-emph>; and after having read and re-read the discourse, and compared together the first and second page of the journal, we became convinced that the pretended <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">workmen</tei-emph> might very well be <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">slaves</tei-emph>; or rather, according to the word now agreed upon, <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">persons not free</tei-emph>. However, as one must always admire something, we admired the delicacy of language of civilized races and the governmental modesty of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Halgan</tei-persName>.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      What is no less curious is the dialogue established between the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">governor</tei-roleName>, in his opening speech, and the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">colonial councillors</tei-roleName>, in the address in reply to the said speech. You will see that these latter stand less upon ceremony.\n      <tei-q data-origname=\"q\">\n        «The losses of commerce (<tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">of commerce!</tei-emph>) will be easily repaired, if the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">fidelity of the gangs</tei-emph> (again) <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">is no longer shaken by the contagion of fatal doctrines, the bait of an illusory liberty</tei-emph> (this is too much, even for colonists) and the disappointments of an organized hiring-out, which is still favoured by the absence of any penal provision.»\n      </tei-q>\n      No: since languages have existed, there has never been so extraordinary a use made of words. <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Slaves shaken by the contagion of fatal doctrines which push them toward an illusory liberty..... and the disappointments of an organized hiring-out, which strike at their fidelity....</tei-emph> This may give an idea of the confusion that reigned at the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Tower of Babel</tei-emph>. The ancients who established slavery at least had logic: they relied upon the law of the stronger, and they applied it without mercy to those who revolted; but they did not complain of revolt. They never constructed syllogisms for slaves, to prove to them that, in breaking their irons, they were running after an illusory liberty. There are people who pretend that these gentle turns of phrase, used to express abuses so melancholy, announce a great improvement. We wish it with all our heart; but for ourselves, we see in it only the desire to preserve, under names less strange, a power of which no one ever strips himself voluntarily, and not the shame of still exercising it.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-pb n=\"43\" facs=\"v1n7f43\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      If you would know what <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Halgan</tei-persName> replied to this harsh contradiction of the <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">colonial council</tei-orgName>, he said:\n      <tei-q data-origname=\"q\">\n        «I am grateful, and I thank you for the sentiments you express toward me.»\n      </tei-q>\n      There is really no need: Mr. the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Governor</tei-roleName> is not hard to please. And, in the end, in spite of his formidable cocked hat, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Halgan</tei-persName> is at bottom a worthy man, who knows how to take things as they should be taken. We should not even be astonished if, at the close of his thanks, he rose from his arm-chair and put his hand to his hat, to salute the gentlemen councillors.\n    </tei-p>\n  </tei-div>\n</tei-div>\n<tei-div xml:id=\"Chronique\" id=\"Chronique\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"xml:id\">\n  <tei-head n=\"Chronique.\" data-origname=\"head\" data-origatts=\"n\">CHRONICLE.</tei-head>\n\n  <tei-div xml:id=\"politique-euro\" id=\"politique-euro\" data-origname=\"div\" data-origatts=\"xml:id\">\n    <tei-head n=\"Politique européenne.—situation.\" data-origname=\"head\" data-origatts=\"n\">EUROPEAN POLITICS.—THE SITUATION.</tei-head>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      Mr. <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Director</tei-roleName> of the\n      <tei-bibl type=\"periodical\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title></tei-bibl>.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      <tei-quote data-origname=\"quote\">\n        «Peoples advance slowly, it is true; but still they advance, said <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">d'Alembert</tei-persName>, and sooner or later they arrive.»\n      </tei-quote>\n      — Do what they may, we shall arrive.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      The most striking symptom of our time, even amid the confusion of doctrines and principles, is that, willingly or unwillingly, nations desire to govern themselves.

The retrograde movement appears, in some quarters, to triumph. Be it as it may, the elements of social progress are so numerous, they act on every side with so much power, the press is so formidable an auxiliary of the future, that there is nothing to fear from the counter-revolutionary efforts which are about to be seriously renewed.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      For you, my friend, the affairs of <tei-placeName ref=\"#EUR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Europe</tei-placeName> have a double interest: you live among us; you have our concerns at heart because you are enlightened and generous, and because, all things considered, they are yours to-day; but also, in the first place, because you know that every fortunate step accomplished here in favour of our liberty profits <tei-pb n=\"44\" facs=\"v1n7f44\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>, in the end, universal liberty,—humanity itself,—one of whose dearest branches for you is the race of colour, oppressed in all its shades. Hence, above all, your solicitude; hence the high interest with which you regard the party which, in <tei-placeName ref=\"#EUR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Europe</tei-placeName>, is for liberty and the common right against every kind of privilege, and which is called the party of movement, in opposition to the party of the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">statu quo</tei-emph>, which at any price would maintain what exists, because what exists is its profit.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      You know it: my policy is very simple. I see in our Europe, as in your dear colonies, only slaves and masters, oppressors and oppressed. To put an end to this state of things everywhere,—such is the labour of the movement; to maintain it,—such is that of resistance. In presence of these two great principles disputing the world, I confess it, I am for the stronger,—that is to say, not for him who triumphs to-day almost everywhere, but for him who will triumph inevitably and definitively to-morrow. Our cause is the holy cause of majorities; and if we wished to translate our thought into a maxim that should sum it up, we should willingly formulate it thus:\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">\n        In politics, that which profits the greatest number possible is good; that which profits only a few, to the detriment of the greatest number, whatever name may be given to it, is evil.\n      </tei-emph>\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      I have allowed myself, my friend, to speak to you of principles when I had promised you nothing but history: it is because it is well not to walk at hazard, and to show clearly why, and by what motives, one goes in one direction rather than in another.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      We are, decidedly, revolutionists. Let us not be frightened at words. Let us remember that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Jesus Christ</tei-persName> also was called a revolutionist when he brought to the world his doctrine of liberty and equality, and, moreover, was crucified as such (1). The interest of false\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-note data-origname=\"note\">\n      <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n        (1) He chose his disciples from the vilest populace; he prefers the slave to the master, the poor man to the rich, the leper to the man in health; all that weeps, all that has wounds, all that is abandoned by the world, is his delight: power, fortune, and happiness are, on the contrary, eternally threatened by him; he overturns all the common notions of morality; he establishes new relations among men, a new law of nations, a new public faith.\n      </tei-p>\n      <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n        <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">CHATEAUBRIAND</tei-persName>,\n        <tei-bibl type=\"monogr\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Génie du christianisme</tei-title></tei-bibl>.\n      </tei-p>\n    </tei-note>\n\n    <tei-pb n=\"45\" facs=\"v1n7f45\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      gods was but a pretext under which the Roman rulers covered their own interest. They would not have crucified <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">the Galilean</tei-persName> had he preached only novelties without consequence; but he was crucified because he said to the master before the slave, <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">All flesh is vile</tei-emph>, and to the slave before the master, <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">All spirit is divine</tei-emph>, abasing the one by the flesh and raising the other by the spirit; which he completed by these words: <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">All men are the children of God; they are all equal before Him.</tei-emph> To which the Man of peace added: <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Love one another; that is the law.</tei-emph> All this appeared monstrous to the tamers of men, to the Roman aristocrats, who lived gloriously on the blood and sweat of others. Men were moved. There were men who thought then what has been said in our own day, that nothing was more dangerous than an eloquent proletary. They crucified <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Jesus</tei-persName>, the proletary. In truth, I tell you, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Jesus</tei-persName> was, at bottom, more revolutionary than <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Spartacus</tei-persName> himself.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      Therefore, as revolutionists, we have reason to rejoice at more than one happy symptom in the general affairs of the world.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      In <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANG\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">England</tei-placeName> reform establishes itself slowly; the work goes on beneath the surface. Among this patient, laborious people much remains, no doubt, to be done, especially for equality; but they are in the right road; and with the liberty of the press, <tei-placeName ref=\"#ANG\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">England</tei-placeName> will know how to conquer also what she lacks,—that is to say, social equality, equality of manners, the first element of democratic societies.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      The <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Wellington</tei-persName> ministry will be able to do nothing against progress; it must follow and second the movement, or be vanquished by it. Such is the constant march of things. When it is written that an improvement shall be accomplished, the men most opposed to change are led by Providence to lend their hands to it. Once already <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Wellington</tei-persName> was the instrument of the spirit of justice: it was under his ministry that the emancipation of the Catholics of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Irland</tei-placeName> was obtained and promulgated,—that great reinstatement of an entire population deprived of its political rights because it had a faith of its own. It may happen, perhaps, as then, with regard to reform; and it matters little to the people whether it comes to them from <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Wellington</tei-persName> or from <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Grey</tei-persName>, provided they obtain it full and entire. The struggle, besides, will be rude; and the old <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">tory</tei-orgName> spirit, which yields only through selfishness, will show itself refractory to concessions until it\n      <tei-pb n=\"46\" facs=\"v1n7f46\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n      is compelled by force; but we trust <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">John Bull</tei-persName> to compel it.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      As for the official policy of <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName>, I have nothing to tell you: you have seen what a singular ministerial comedy has lately been played; you have seen at work that party of political eunuchs which knows neither how to control power nor how to exercise it. Victory has remained with the doctrinaires. They have the present; but it is the national and patriotic party, which every day acquires new strength, to whom the future belongs; and the <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">French colonies</tei-placeName> have the highest interest in its success; for it is by that party alone that the dearest of your wishes and of mine will be accomplished,—the complete and unreserved abolition of slavery,—and the organization of labour upon new bases in our various establishments beyond the seas.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Spain</tei-placeName>, one of the most backward countries of <tei-placeName ref=\"#EUR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Europe</tei-placeName>, has just entered upon her revolutionary era. The <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\"><tei-bibl type=\"legal\" data-origname=\"bibl\" data-origatts=\"type\"><tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Estatuto real</tei-title></tei-bibl></tei-emph>, wrested by the necessities of the time from the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Queen Christina</tei-roleName>, has awakened the new spirit; on every side the provinces have sent to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Madrid</tei-placeName> deputies of the movement; and the Spanish <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">Cortes</tei-orgName>, forming two chambers under the denomination of the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\"><tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">chambers of procuradores</tei-orgName></tei-emph> and of the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\"><tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">proceres</tei-orgName></tei-emph>, apply themselves to the radical reorganization of the country. The reform of minds is accomplished in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Spain</tei-placeName>; it remains to carry it into the laws and into the institutions. The presence of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Don Carlos</tei-persName>, who plays the king in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Navarre</tei-placeName>, pursued and held in check by <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mina</tei-persName>, serves only to give more strength—not, we will not say to the party of the <tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">Queen</tei-roleName>, but to the <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">national party</tei-orgName>, which is now against legitimacy.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      This poor legitimacy falls almost everywhere before the reason and the will of the age. In <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Portugal</tei-placeName>, however, it has triumphed by the efforts of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Don Pedro</tei-persName>, in the person of his daughter, the young queen <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Dona Maria</tei-persName>. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Miguel</tei-persName> has been definitively driven from the country, and the most rigorous measures have been taken by <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">the chambers</tei-orgName> to prevent his return for ever.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      The ex-<tei-roleName data-origname=\"roleName\">king</tei-roleName> now travels like so many others; and all <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Italy</tei-placeName>, where he plays the legitimate prince and the fop, is full of the noise of his bad tone and his matador manners. At <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Genoa</tei-placeName> he has committed pranks and pasquinades in the streets which indicate, on his part, a cerebral lesion.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-pb n=\"47\" facs=\"v1n7f47\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"facs n\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      Whatever may have been the personal sentiments of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Don Pedro</tei-persName>, having been obliged to lean upon the liberals in order to overcome the absolutist obstinacy of his brother, he was necessarily constrained to favour enlightenment, and <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Portugal</tei-placeName> has gained much by it. Were it only the advantage of having passed from the tyranny of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Don Miguel</tei-persName> under the power of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Dona Maria</tei-persName>, it would already be much. What matters, after that, what <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Don Pedro</tei-persName> really was? Thus goes the world. The least sincere friends of liberty are sometimes forced, by their position, to become its defenders in their own interest; and when they have conquered, and would turn against it—against that which has made them what they are—liberty has taken its place, for good or ill, beside them, and they can no longer drive it wholly away.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      And <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName>, in spite of the ill-will of her governors, presides over the movement which carries the world toward liberty! It is because such is the will of the immense majority of the population. It is because <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName> is the first democracy in the world, and because the principle of equality and liberty is more or less in the mind, if not in the heart, of all. The press, besides, by its thousand organs, incessantly subjects every thing to the spirit of examination; prejudices are effaced by its action, and public control is exercised over all powers and all acts, to the great advantage of the country.\n    </tei-p>\n\n    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n      The press relentlessly breaches every thing that tends to thwart the march of the century, and prepares for the world its new destinies. See, too, how it is treated! But persecutions will avail nothing. The press is to-day necessary to social transactions no less than to those of politics; it forms an integral part of our institutions; it is itself an institution,—the most vital of all. Journalism, above all, in spite of the rigours to which it is subjected, pursues its salutary and ascending course. It is not you to whom one must depict the marvellous effects of these intellectual communications, which in a few days carry the same facts to the knowledge of an entire country, and make, at the same moment, upon the same object, thousands of minds think,—minds that tend toward one another in spite of distance, and end by uniting, after mature examination, in a community of just ideas and noble sentiments.

Les incidents entre les deux groupes qui se multiplient mêlent conflits personnels et solidarités de groupes. À la fin de l’année 1833, dans la soirée du 3 novembre, Romagé, rentrant du spectacle, aurait apostrophé un homme de couleur. L’altercation qui s’en suivit aurait entraîné un rassemblement considérable de libres de couleur. Dans les jours qui suivent, les conflits se poursuivent et donnent lieu à plusieurs arrestations, dont Romagé. Les autorités, en l’occurrence le Conseil Privé, de la Guadeloupe, décident d’exclure du canton de Pointe-à-Pitre ceux qui avaient été à l’origine de ces altercations.

He began practicing law in 1821, earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1822, became a lawyer and proprietor in 1825, was admitted to the royal court of Martinique and the court of 1era authority of Saint-Pierre in 1827, and was, between 1843 and 1844, a  colonial advisor and member of the municipal council of Saint-Pierre. As a defender of slavery, Ciceron was a political enemy of Cyrille Bissette through the 1830s; in October 1834, the two dueled in the Bois de Vincennes. Their political enmity is perceptible in several articles by Ciceron published in Journal du Havre in 1831, widely repeated in his “Petition to the King, to the nation and to the chambers” (dated January 1, 1832). Bissette responded to him in a letter dated May 15, 1833. In 1844, Cicero, present in Paris, acted as rapporteur for the “Observations of a special commission of the Colonial Council of Martinique on the bill presented on May 14 to the Chamber of Peers.”. These observations, signed by Le Pelletier-Duclary, president of the Colonial Council, concerned a bill for the abolition of slavery in the French colonies, refuting it point by point. Bissette's apparent good will towards former enslavers after the abolition of May 1848, and his association with the colonist Pécoul around legislative elections of 1849, brought him closer to Ciceron, whom he visited upon his return to Martinique on March 20, 1849.</tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Fils du notaire blanc créole guadeloupéen, Ambroise Cicéron et de Marie Victoire Artaud, Louis Marie Ambroise Dieudonné Cicéron est né à Saint-Pierre le 25 septembre 1797 et meurt le 11 avril 1870 en la même ville. Il est qualifié de praticien en 1821, étudiant en droit bachelier ès lettres (1822), avocat et propriétaire (1825), avocat avoué près la cour royale de la Martinique et le tribunal de 1ère instance de Saint-Pierre (1827), conseiller colonial, membre du conseil municipal de Saint-Pierre et propriétaire en cette ville (1843-1844). Partisan du maintien du système esclavagiste, Louis Cicéron est opposé à Cyrille Bissette durant les années 1830-1840. Il se bat d’ailleurs en duel en octobre 1834 avec Bissette au bois de Vincennes. Leur inimitié politique est perceptible dans plusieurs articles de Cicéron publiés au journal du Havre en 1831, repris largement dans sa “Pétition au Roi, à la nation et aux chambres” (datée du 1er janvier 1832). Bissette lui répond dans une lettre du 15 mai 1833 ensuite. En 1844, Cicéron, présent à Paris, se fait le rapporteur des “Observations d’une commission spéciale du Conseil colonial de la Martinique sur le projet de loi présenté le 14 mai dernier à la Chambre des Pairs. Paris : Impr. de Bruneau, 1844”. Ces “observations, signées de Le Pelletier-Duclary, président du Conseil colonial, portaient sur le projet de loi du 14 mai 1844, visant à l’abolition de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises, et le réfutant article après article...”. Le retournement de veste de Bissette vis-à-vis des colons esclavagistes après l’abolition de l’esclavage en mai 1848, son association avec le colon Pécoul en vue des élections législatives de 1849, le fit se rapprocher de Cicéron qu’il visita dès son arrivée en Martinique le 20 mars 1849.</tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n        </tei-person>\n        <tei-person xml:id=\"LePell\" id=\"LePell\" data-origname=\"person\" data-origatts=\"xml:id\">\n            <tei-persName xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Jean-Baptiste François Le Pelletier-Duclary</tei-persName>\n            <tei-persName xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Jean-Baptiste François Le Pelletier-Duclary</tei-persName>\n            <tei-birth data-origname=\"birth\">1791 or 1793</tei-birth>\n            <tei-death data-origname=\"death\">1865</tei-death>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lawyer at the court of Paris, assessor to the Superior Council of Martinique (took offic 1819), councilor to the Royal Court of Martinique (May 9, 1821, confirmed October 5 1828), of which he became president in January 1835, knight of the Legion of Honor (January 16, 1836), president of the Colonial Council of Martinique from 1834 to 1838 and from 1839 to 1847. He married Marie Elisabeth Nelly Cornette de Saint-Cyr, a white Creole woman on June 11, 1821 in Case Pilote. Like many white settlers, he refused any reformation of the slave system, particularly in favor of equality for free people of color. He was one of the members of the Assize Court of Saint-Pierre chaired by de Perinelle who judged the 173 individuals accused during the Grande Anse affair (Lorrain) of December 1833. He shared quite naturally the prejudices and principles inherent in the mentality and social group of the powerful white families of the colony who made up the colonial judiciary between the decades of 1820 and 1840. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">https://www.patrimoines-martinique.org/ark:/35569/w6lcx297j5p0/c1f43fd7-b3e2-4d32-b04f-d620bbbbf54e</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">https://man8rove.com/en/profile/eql4p4vv1-jean-baptiste-francois-le-pelletier-du-clary</tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Né le 26 décembre 1791 ou le 28 janvier 1793 à Case-Pilote en Martinique selon les sources consultées, décédé le 12 juillet 1865 à Case-Pilote, habitant propriétaire domicilié dans cette paroisse et quartier, avocat à la cour de Paris, assesseur au Conseil supérieur de la Martinique en fonctions en 1819, conseiller à la Cour royale de la Martinique (9 mai 1821, confirmé le 5 octobre 1828) dont il est président en janvier 1835, chevalier de la légion d’honneur (16 janvier 1836), président du Conseil colonial de la Martinique de 1834 à 1838 et de 1839 à 1847.

In his new role, he proposed set of gradualist laws in anticipation of the abolition of slavery in the French colonies. The 1845 Mackau laws, as they came to be known, improved conditions for the enslaved, promoted their access to religious instruction, and allowed for the practice of buying one’s freedom or the freedom of one’s kin (<tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">rachat</tei-emph>).

Les lois Mackau de 1845, comme elles seront appelées, visent à améliorer les conditions de vie des personnes réduites en esclavage, à favoriser leur accès à l’instruction religieuse et à encadrer la possibilité de rachat, leur permettant ainsi d’acheter leur liberté ou celle de leurs proches. Si ces mesures sont largement saluées, Bissette les condamne avec vigueur dans ses écrits, dénonçant leur gradualisme.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Dorigny, Marcel; Bruffaerts, Jean-Claude; Gaillard, Gusti-Klara; et Théodat, Jean-Marie, eds.,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Haïti-France.

Later, he was advisor to the royal court of Rouen in 1845. Married to the daughter of a coffee merchant and planter of Guadeloupean origin, Jean Joseph Albert Chaviteau, who settled in Cuba at the beginning of the 19th century, Nogues had strong ties to the planter community. Nogues represented the public prosecutor as attorney general during the Grande Anse affair in December 1833. The indictment prepared by Nogues in June 1834, recovered by the historian Armand Nicolas describes the events thusly: “It is an armed insurrection, prepared for a long time... by almost the entire colored population of a district of the colony, with whom conspirators from another district and even from several others had colluded to carry out the pillage, devastation and burning of the colony, to massacre all the whites there in order to seize their property.” The members of the Assize Court of Saint-Pierre, presided over by de Perinelle and composed of advisors Richard de Lucy, Le Pelletier, and Duclary, the same ones who condemned Bissette and his comrades, were all white Creoles. They sentenced 141 individuals of color to various punishments.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Nicolas, Armand,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Histoire de la Martinique, Des Arawaks à 1848</tei-emph> , Paris, L’Harmattan, 1996</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">\"Arsène Nogues,\"  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Man8rove.</tei-emph>  https://man8rove.com/fr/profile/a1r52vc3-arsene-nogues</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">\"CHAUVITEAU Jean Joseph Albert (1775-1823),\"  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Cimetière du Père-Lachaise</tei-emph> , 3 septembre 2023, https://www.appl-lachaise.net/chauviteau-jean-joseph-albert-1775-1823/</tei-bibl>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Né à Redon le 12 juin 1798, il occupe divers postes à Brest et à Nancy et est aussi procureur général en Guadeloupe puis en Martinique durant les années 1830. Puis, il est ensuite conseiller à la cour royale de Rouen en 1845. Marié à la fille d’un négociant et planteur de café d’origine guadeloupéenne, Jean Joseph Albert Chaviteau, qui se fixa à Cuba au début du XIXe siècle, il est donc lié fortement au milieu des colons. Arsène Nogues, est celui qui représente le ministère public en tant que procureur général lors de l’affaire de la Grande Anse (commune du Lorrain aujourd’hui) en décembre 1833. L’historien Armand Nicolas cite ainsi l’acte d’accusation en juin 1834 que Arsène Nogues dresse en notifiant que : “C’est une insurrection à main armée, préparée depuis longtemps... par la presque totalité de la population de couleur d’un quartier de la colonie, avec laquelle des conspirateurs d’un autre quartier et même de plusieurs autres s’étaient entendus pour porter le pillage, la dévastation et l’incendie de la colonie, pour y massacrer tous les Blancs afin de s’emparer de leurs biens”. Au nombre des membres de la Cour d’Assises de Saint-Pierre présidée par de Perinelle et composée de conseillers (Richard de Lucy, Le Pelletier Duclary), tous blancs créoles, les mêmes qui ont condamné Bissette et ses camarades, se trouve donc des hommes imbus de leurs pouvoirs discrétionnaires.

During the Haitian Revolution, he served first as a lieutenant and then aide de camp for Louverture; he was promoted to colonel and then, as part of the expedition to take the eastern side of the island, was named brigadier general and commander of the district of Santo Domingo. After Louverture’s unlawful arrest and deportation in June 1802, Bélair raised the banner of revolt against the French expeditionary forces. Leclerc’s forces arrested his wife and mother, forcing Bélair out of hiding and leading ot his capture. He was executed on October 15, 1802. To the history of Charles Bélair must be added that of his wife, Sanite Bélair, a warrior in her own right who fought beside the insurgents.

In the immediate aftermath of the American Revolution, he opposed efforts to implement large-scale emancipation in his home state of Massachusetts, but, as primary author of the state’s constitution, which included a Declaration of Rights (written after Adams served as Envoy to France), Adams has long been associated with the state’s de facto abolition in 1780. It was only after the 1781 cases of Mum Bett and Quok Walker, enslaved people who cited the language of the constitution in suing for their freedom, that the document, which does not explicitly prohibit slavery, took on this accepted meaning. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">John Adams’s presidency is notably marked by the establishment of trade relations with Haiti, which was then in conflict with France.  These political positions, in combination with an 1801 letter in which he expresses “abhorrence” to the institution of slavery, claiming to have always employed free men at significant personal expense, have contributed to Adams’ enduring legacy as a committed abolitionist. Recently, historians have called attention to the ways in which his positions were more in line with contemporaries, noting both that, with regard to Haiti, agreement to continue commerce is hardly a statement of ideological sympathy, and that any actual belief in the principle of equality was never public or explicit.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#masha #michaël\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">John Adams est originaire du Nord des États-Unis et n’a jamais possédé d’esclaves, ce qui le distingue des premiers présidents américains. Bien qu’opposé à l’émancipation générale des esclaves dans son État natal du Massachusetts après la Révolution, il rédige pour le jeune État une constitution qui comprend une Déclaration des droits (il rentre alors d’une mission diplomatique en France) et œuvre de fait à la disparition progressive de l’esclavage dans le Massachusetts. Dans les années qui suivent l’adoption de la constitution en 1780, des personnes esclavisées telles que Mum Bett et Quok Walker n'hésitent pas à invoquer ce document pour poursuivre leur maître et réclamer leur liberté devant les tribunaux.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Le mandat de John Adams est notamment marqué par l’établissement de relations commerciales avec Haïti, alors en conflit avec la France. Ses prises de position politiques, ainsi qu’une lettre de 1801 dans laquelle il exprime sa « détestation » de l’esclavage et affirme avoir toujours employé des hommes libres, même lorsque le coût de leur travail était élevé, ont largement contribué à forger sa réputation d’abolitionniste engagé.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Cette image a toutefois été nuancée par l’historiographie récente, qui souligne la proximité d’Adams avec ses contemporains sur la question de l’esclavage. Le maintien des échanges avec Haïti, par exemple, ne traduit pas nécessairement une sympathie à l’égard de l’indépendance haïtienne, et Adams ne s’est jamais publiquement ni explicitement exprimé en faveur de l’égalité raciale.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n        </tei-person>\n        <tei-person xml:id=\"CB\" id=\"CB\" data-origname=\"person\" data-origatts=\"xml:id\">\n            <tei-persName xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Bissette, Cyrille Charles Auguste</tei-persName>\n            <tei-persName xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Bissette, Cyrille Charles Auguste </tei-persName>\n            <tei-birth data-origname=\"birth\">1795</tei-birth>\n            <tei-death data-origname=\"death\">1858</tei-death>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#masha\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-figure data-origname=\"figure\">\n                    <tei-graphic url=\"portrait_Bissette_b827ac99f2.jpg\" data-origname=\"graphic\" data-origatts=\"url\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n                    <tei-figDesc data-origname=\"figDesc\">Portrait de Cyrille Bissette.

His parents, Charles Borromée Bissette and Elizabeth Mélanie Bellaine, were free people of color, and his mother was the illegitimate daughter of Joseph-Gaspard de Tascher de La Pagerie, making Bissette a nephew of Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In 1816, Bissette married Augustine Séverin, a free woman of color, with whom he had four children. During these early years in Fort-Royal, Bissette was not engaged in abolitionist activities, and was in fact himself a slaveowner, taking part, in 1822, in the suppression of a slave revolt in the village of Le Carbet. The following year, however, he was arrested, along with six other free men of color — Montlouis Thébia, Joseph Richer, Joseph Millet, Laborde, Louis Fabien, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">fils</tei-title> and Jean-Baptiste Volny — for possession and alleged distribution of a seditious pamphlet printed in Paris, entitled <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">De la situation des hommes de color libre aux Antilles françaises </tei-title>(which Bissette was alleged to have written).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Accused as architects of a plot to overthrow the segregationist organization of Martinican society, Bissette, Fabien, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">fils</tei-title> and Volny were branded and sentenced to the galleys for life. In 1827, with the help of attorney François Isambert, Bissette’s sentence was reduced to ten years’ banishment and the legal costs of the proceedings, which would remain a substantial burden. Garnering significant media coverage, the so-called <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Affaire Bissette </tei-title>catalyzed his political career.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In Paris, Bissette participated in the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Trois Glorieuses </tei-title>(“the three glorious days” of riots that led to the end of the reign of Charles X and the restored Bourbon dynasty), which earned him the decoration of the July Cross, frequented Republican circles such as the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Free Association for the Education of the People</tei-title>, joined a Masonic lodge, published several emancipatory petitions, and founded the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies, </tei-title>a press organ for the cause of the total and immediate abolition of slavery. This radical position would put him at odds with the majority of the French abolitionist community, including Victor Schoelcher, the eventual author of the 1848 decree. The distance between these two abolitionists develops into a rivalry after the publication of Schoelcher’s <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Des Colonies Françaises</tei-title>, which Bissette harshly criticizes for its stigmatizing, indeed, uninhibitedly racist, characterization of the free population of color of the Antilles. Overshadowed by the cult of Schoelcher in the assimilationist intellectual bourgeoisie, Bissette is deliberately written out of abolitionist history for his later reconciliationist platform and his strategic alliance with a white planter in the legislative elections of 1849.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bongie, Chris. “1835, ou ‘Le troisième cycle’: The Creole Afterlives of Cyrille-Charles Auguste Bissette, Louis de Maynard de Queilhe, and Victor Schoelcher.” In  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Islands and Exiles: The Creole Identities of Post/Colonial Literature</tei-title> .

He entered military service in 1785 in the Royale-Marine regiment and quickly rose through the ranks. Appointed second lieutenant in 1792 in the 21st Cavalry Regiment, he distinguished himself during the campaigns of the Revolution, the Consulate, and the Empire between 1793 and 1807, earning a promotion to divisional general on December 6, 1807. In 1815, he fought at Waterloo and continued his career under the Bourbon Restoration. On October 31, 1817, Louis XVIII appointed him civil and military governor of Martinique, a position he held until 1826 before requesting to return to France.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">His administration was marked by his firm support for maintaining the slave system, which earned him the favor of the island’s white plantation owners. In October 1822, during the slave uprising in Le Carbet, he ordered a violent crackdown led by white militias and free men of color, among whom was Cyrille Bissette. Although he initially showed some willingness to listen to the grievances of Fort-Royal’s free people of color, particularly those voiced by Bissette, Donzelot gradually distanced himself from this stance. Pressured by white landowners determined to protect their privileges and exclude free people of color from any claim to equality, he became convinced that they harbored rebellious intentions and sought to incite an uprising akin to that of Saint-Domingue.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The Bissette Affair (1823-1824) definitively aligned him with the interests of the slaveholding elite. Under his governance, more than two hundred individuals were deported without trial. In 1826, he was granted his request to return to France. He retired to Mamirolle before settling in Neuilly-sur-Marne, where he died on July 11, 1843.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Schloss, Rebecca Hartkopf.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Sweet Liberty: The Final Days of Slavery in Martinique</tei-title>  .

Il entre au service en 1785 dans le régiment Royale-Marine et gravit rapidement les échelons militaires. Nommé sous-lieutenant en 1792 au 21ᵉ régiment de cavalerie, il se distingue lors des campagnes de la Révolution, du Consulat et de l’Empire entre 1793 et 1807, ce qui lui vaut d’être promu général de division le 6 décembre 1807. En 1815, il se distingue à Waterloo, poursuivant ensuite sa carrière sous la Restauration. Le 31 octobre 1817, Louis XVIII le nomme gouverneur civil et militaire de la Martinique, un poste qu’il occupe jusqu’en 1826, avant de demander son rappel en Métropole.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Son administration est marquée par son soutien au maintien du système esclavagiste, ce qui lui vaut l’estime des colons blancs de l’île. En octobre 1822, lors de la révolte des esclaves du Carbet, il ordonne une répression brutale menée par les milices blanches et les libres de couleur, parmi lesquels figure Cyrille Bissette. Bien qu’ayant initialement prêté une oreille attentive aux doléances des libres de couleur de Fort-Royal, notamment sous l’impulsion de Bissette, Donzelot s’éloigne progressivement de cette position. Harcelé par les propriétaires blancs, soucieux de préserver leurs privilèges et d’exclure les libres de couleur de toute prétention à l’égalité, il se laisse convaincre que ces derniers nourrissent des velléités de révolte et qu’ils aspirent à un soulèvement comparable à celui de Saint-Domingue.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">L’affaire Bissette (1823-1824) scelle définitivement son alignement sur les intérêts des planteurs esclavagistes.

Il se retire à Mamirolle avant de s’établir à Neuilly-sur-Marne, où il meurt le 11 juillet 1843.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Schloss, Rebecca Hartkopf.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Sweet Liberty: The Final Days of Slavery in Martinique</tei-title>  .

Deeply in debt through the end of his life, Jefferson manumitted very few people despite expressing abhorrence to the institution on numerous occasions.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">His public comments on slavery, whether in the colonial context of <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">A Summary View of the Rights of British America</tei-emph> (1774) or in the early republic, as in <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Notes on the State of Virginia</tei-emph> (1785), his most well-known commentary on the subject, stress the risks and complications of any potential abolition while stopping short of defending the practice outright. In an early draft of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson blames George III for forcefully maintaining the slave trade in North America, though this condemnation is less a matter of moral outrage than fear of organized rebellion. Jefferson received a copy of <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">De la littérature des Nègres</tei-emph> (1808), a work excerpted in numerous issues of the Revue des Colonies, directly from Abbé Grégoire. His response actually criticizes the work, whose arguments for equal humanity depend on the intellectual accomplishments of Black people, for implying that rights should be bound to talent. For his own part, Jefferson was notably dismissive of the intellectual talents of Benjamin Banneker, the free-born Black polymath who wrote to him in 1791 demanding (unsuccessfully) that he act according to his professed principles and Phillis Wheatley, the enslaved poet whose work was widely circulated on both sides of the Atlantic.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Notes</tei-emph>, published in France (while Jefferson was serving as minister to the court of Louis XVI) as a response to questions posed to the Continental Congress by delegate François Barbé-Marbois, Jefferson argues that any large-scale emancipation project would destabilize the young state by plunging it into violent racial conflict. As an alternative, he takes up the nascent cause of colonization, a position roundly criticized by later American abolitionists, most notably David Walker in his <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Appeal</tei-emph> (1829). At this time, Jefferson was living with Sally Hemings, an enslaved woman of mixed race and his deceased wife’s half-sister. This sexual relationship, to which Hemings would have had no meaningful way of consenting, was believed to have lasted four decades, producing several children. Hemings experienced the conditions of legal freedom for the first time while in France and returned to Virginia only on the condition that Jefferson would emancipate their children upon their reaching adulthood.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Finkelman, Paul.  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Slavery and the Founders : Race and Liberty in the Age of Jefferson</tei-emph> .

Lourdement endetté, Jefferson émancipe très peu de personnes au cours de sa vie, et ce alors même qu’il exprime à de nombreuses reprises des positions critiques sur l’esclavage.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Jefferson évoque la question de l’esclavage dans plusieurs de ses écrits, en particulier <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">A Summary View of the Rights of British America</tei-emph> (1774) et <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Notes on the State of Virginia</tei-emph> (1785), son texte le plus connu. S’il ne défend pas l’institution esclavagiste, il insiste cependant sur les risques et les difficultés de son abolition éventuelle. Dans une première version de la Déclaration d’indépendance, Jefferson reproche à George III d’avoir maintenu la traite en Amérique du Nord, ce qui traduit moins une indignation morale que la crainte de voir les esclaves se soulever. Lorsque l’abbé Grégoire publie <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">De la littérature des nègres</tei-emph> en 1808, dont de nombreux extraits sont reproduits dans la Revue des Colonies, il fait parvenir un exemplaire à Jefferson. Dans sa réponse à Grégoire, Jefferson critique l’ouvrage, qui, en s’appuyant sur les accomplissements intellectuels des personnes noires pour défendre l’égalité humaine, suggère que les droits humains devraient être conditionnés au talent.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">En outre, Jefferson fait preuve de condescendance envers Benjamin Banneker, mathématicien noir né libre, qui lui adresse une lettre en 1791 l’exhortant (sans succès) à agir en cohérence avec ses principes égalitaires, ainsi qu’envers Phillis Wheatley, poétesse esclavisée dont les œuvres sont largement diffusées des deux côtés de l’Atlantique.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Dans <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Notes on the State of Virginia</tei-emph>, publié en réponse aux questions posées au Congrès continental par François Barbé-Marbois alors que Jefferson occupe le poste de ministre plénipotentiaire des États-Unis à la cour de Louis XVI, il soutient qu’un projet d’émancipation à grande échelle risquerait de déstabiliser la nation naissante en provoquant des conflits raciaux violents. Jefferson choisit plutôt d’adhérer à la cause dite de la colonisation – c’est-à-dire l’expatriation des plus ou moins contrainte des Africains-Américains libres –, un projet que les abolitionnistes américains critiqueront fermement par la suite, à l’instar de David Walker dans <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World</tei-emph> (1829).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">À la fin des années 1780, Jefferson vit en concubinage avec Sally Hemings, femme de couleur esclavisée et demi-sœur de sa défunte épouse. Cette relation, à laquelle Hemings ne pouvait consentir, aurait duré près de quarante ans et a généré une descendance. Hemings fait pour la première fois l’expérience de la liberté lorsqu’elle est en France et n’accepte de retourner en Virginie qu’à la condition que Jefferson s’engage à affranchir leurs enfants à leur majorité.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Finkelman, Paul.  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Slavery and the Founders : Race and Liberty in the Age of Jefferson</tei-emph> .

During the Revolution, Washington, conceding to the demands of war after initial reluctance, led an integrated Continental Army, including free and enslaved men of color. As President, however, Washington carefully avoided maintaining consistent residence in Philadelphia, the nation’s first capital, to avoid being subject to Pennsylvania’s gradual abolition act of 1780.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Washington was a third-generation enslaver, who, at the time of his death in 1799, held personal claim to 123 enslaved people, while his Virginia home and plantation, Mount Vernon, benefited from the labor of over 300 in total, the remainder being temporary laborers or enslaved people inherited from the estate of his wife’s first husband. In his will, published widely in U.S. papers, he stipulated emancipation for those in his personal estate upon Martha Washington’s death, suggesting a moral stance while notably deferring financial loss to his inheritors. Meanwhile, through the final years of his life, he continued a relentless pursuit of Ona Judge, a young enslaved woman who had fled Mount Vernon for New Hampshire. In seeking to recover her, he refused her willing return on the condition of being freed after his and Martha’s deaths, and only hesitated to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 for fear of drawing negative publicity to the case and galvanizing northern abolitionists.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Historians continue to debate Washington’s personal degree of comfort with or distaste for the institution of slavery, and whether he harbored any conviction to endorse gradual abolition.  François Furstenberg has drawn attention to his bound collection of antislavery tracts from American and European sources while noting that several of these works were never opened and his sentiments on the matter were restricted to private correspondence.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Dunbar, Erica Armstrong.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge</tei-title>  .  New York: 37 Ink/Atria, 2017.</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Rossignol, Marie-Jeanne and Michaël Roy, with Marlene L.

Dans sa quête de soutien français pour l’indépendance américaine, il ne lie pas explicitement cette cause à celle de l’émancipation. Pendant la Révolution, Washington, contraint par les impératifs de la guerre,dirige une armée non ségréguée, qui inclut des hommes de couleur libres et asservis. En tant que président, Washington s’est toutefois soigneusement abstenu de résider de manière prolongée à Philadelphie, première capitale du pays, afin d’éviter d’être soumis à la loi d’abolition graduelle de l’esclavage adoptée par la Pennsylvanie en 1780.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Issu d’une famille d’esclavagistes vieille de trois générations, Washington possède à sa mort, en 1799, quelque 123 personnes esclavisées. En tout, plus de 300 personnes travaillent dans sa plantation de Mount Vernon, en Virginie, parmi lesquelles des travailleurs temporaires et des esclaves hérités du premier mariage de sa femme, Martha. Dans son testament, largement diffusé dans la presse américaine, Washington prévoit que ses esclaves seront émancipés à la mort de son épouse, ce qui lui permet d’afficher une posture morale tout en reportant les pertes financières sur ses héritiers. Parallèlement, durant les dernières années de sa vie, il poursuit sans relâche Ona Judge, une jeune femme asservie qui s’est enfuie de Mount Vernon et a gagné le New Hampshire. Lorsque celle-ci propose de revenir à la condition que sa liberté lui soit accordée après la mort de George et Martha, Washington refuse ; de même, il hésite à se saisir de la loi sur les esclaves fugitifs de 1793, craignant que cela n’attire l’attention et ne galvanise les abolitionnistes du Nord.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Les historiens continuent de débattre de la position plus ou moins critique de Washington sur l’esclavage et de son degré d’adhésion au projet d’une abolition graduelle de l’institution. François Furstenberg s’est notamment intéressé à sa collection de livres, qui comprend plusieurs brochures abolitionnistes publiées en Europe et en Amérique du Nord. Il note cependant que certains de ces volumes n’ont jamais été ouverts, et que les réflexions de Washington sur la question restent cantonnées à sa correspondance privée.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Dunbar, Erica Armstrong.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\"><tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge</tei-emph></tei-title> .  New York: 37 Ink/Atria, 2017.</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Rossignol, Marie-Jeanne et Michaël Roy, avec Marlene L.

He became involved in a dispute between the white Creole Louis Lasserre and the free man of color, Faustin Rosemond, whose home was sold, by judicial decision, to Lasserre. Rosemond is said to have shot Lasserre's horse while the latter was on his property in August 1833. He was charged with attempted assassination for being present at the scene where Rosemond and his brother-in-law committed the act. The Assize Court of Saint-Pierre, meeting on December 21, 1833, was expeditious and condemned Césaire for “complicity in an attempted assassination on the person of Lasserre, with premeditation and ambush”. On the island, the announcement of the conviction had an immediate and powerful effect, catalyzing the uprising of the free men of color of Grande Anse (December 24) within a few days. In the Revue des Colonies, Bissette would become Césaire’s most vocal defender. On April 4, 1834, lawyer Gatine presented the “means of cassation”. The Court of Cassation ruled on the following September 13 and overturned Césaire's judgment. He was retried on February 16 and 17, 1835 and was acquitted. Bissette declared himself satisfied with the outcome. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Pâme, Stella.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Cyrille Bissette: un martyr de la liberté</tei-title> .

Dans l’ile, l’annonce de la condamnation fait l’effet d’un coup de tonnerre et précède le soulèvement des hommes de couleur libres de la Grande Anse (le 24 décembre) de quelques jours.

He was the eldest son of Louis Philippe Joseph, Duke of Orléans (known as Philippe Égalité), and Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre. A supporter of the French Revolution, he joined the National Guard and enlisted in the revolutionary army, participating in the battles of Valmy and Jemappes. Accused of treason, he was outlawed by the revolutionary government. During the Reign of Terror, in November 1793, his father, Philippe-Égalité, was arrested and guillotined.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">That same year, Louis-Philippe began a long exile, living in Switzerland and Germany in 1795, the United States in 1796, and finally settling in England in 1800. In 1809, he married Princess Marie-Amélie of Bourbon, daughter of the King of Naples, in Sicily. After several failed attempts to return to France, Louis XVIII authorized his return in 1814 and restored his father’s confiscated properties. However, he remained excluded from the royal court until 1817.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">More than a decade later, from July 27 to 29, 1830, the people of Paris rose up in what became known as the Three Glorious Days (<tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Trois Glorieuses</tei-emph>). Following Charles X’s flight, Louis-Philippe was propelled to power on July 30, 1830. Under the Restoration, Charles X had pursued policies that strongly favored property owners, including the ordinance of April 17, 1825, which imposed the Haitian indemnity to compensate former colonists, and the law of April 27, 1825, known as the Billion for the Emigrés, which indemnified émigrés who had lost property confiscated and sold during the Revolution. Seeking to navigate opposition from republicans, Bonapartists, legitimists, and socialists, Louis-Philippe adopted a liberal political approach.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In the old colonies, which also underwent abrupt political change in 1830, the long cycle of segregation against free people of color came to an end with a series of local and metropolitan egalitarian measures. At the same time, despite growing calls from abolitionists, particularly the French Society for the Abolition of Slavery (SFAE), founded in 1834, the regime sought to preserve slavery—at least in the short term—implementing gradual reforms rather than outright abolition. The July Monarchy also pursued an aggressive colonial expansion policy, marked by the conquest of Algeria in 1830 and the acquisition of key strategic territories along major maritime routes, including Nosy Be, Mayotte, Tahiti, and the Marquesas Islands.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The February 22–25, 1848 uprising in Paris forced Louis-Philippe to abdicate and flee to Britain. Queen Victoria granted him residence at Claremont House in Surrey, where he died two years later, on August 26, 1850. In the colonies, the fall of the July Monarchy and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Second Republic in February 1848 accelerated the abolition of slavery. Within two months, the decree was issued, officially abolishing slavery on April 27, 1848.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Jennings, Lawrence, \"Abolitionnisme, jeu politique et réforme : France, 1814-1848\", in Pétré Grenouilleau Olivier (dir),  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Abolir l’esclavage.

Il est le fils aîné de Louis Philippe Joseph, duc de Bourgogne (dit Philippe Égalité) et d’Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre. Partisan de la Révolution française, il rejoint la Garde nationale et s’engage dans l’armée révolutionnaire. Il participe aux batailles de Valmy et de Jemmapes. Accusé de traitrise, il est proscrit du gouvernement révolutionnaire.

En 1809, il épouse en Sicile la princesse Marie-Amélie de Bourbon, fille du roi de Naples. Après plusieurs tentatives de retour, Louis XVIII l’autorise à rentrer en France en 1814 et lui rend les biens de son père. Il sera cependant maintenu à l’écart de la cour jusqu’en 1817.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Plus d’une décennie plus tard, les 27, 28 et 29 juillet 1830, le peuple parisien se soulève. Ce sont les trois glorieuses. Louis-Philippe est alors propulsé au pouvoir le 30 juillet 1830, dès la fuite de Charles X qui, sous la Restauration, mena une politique très favorable aux intérêts des propriétaires (ordonnance du 17 avril 1825 sur l’indemnité haïtienne destinée aux anciens colons de la colonie ; loi du « milliard des émigrés du 27 avril 1825 indemnisant les émigrés ayant perdu leurs biens vendus sous la Révolution). Afin de ménager ses nombreuses oppositions (républicains, bonapartistes, légitimistes et socialistes), Louis-Philippe choisit de mener une politique libérale.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Dans les « vieilles colonies » - elles aussi précipitées en 1830 dans ce brusque changement de régime politique - le cycle de ségrégations à l’encontre des libres de couleur s’achève avec une série de mesures égalitaires locales et métropolitaines. Dans le même temps, et malgré les nombreux appels des abolitionnistes, notamment ceux de la Société française pour l’abolition de l’esclavage (SFAE) fondée en 1834, le régime se place dans une logique de maintien de l’esclavage, du moins à court terme, et propose de lents aménagements, à défaut d’une abolition radicale. La Monarchie de Juillet mène par ailleurs une politique d’expansion coloniale marquée, dès 1830, par la conquête de l’Algérie, d’une part, et par l’acquisition, comme points de relâche ou d’appui sur les grandes routes maritimes, de nouveaux territoires (Nossibé, Mayotte, Tahiti, Marquises).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Le soulèvement du peuple de Paris entre le 22 et le 25 février 1848 conduit Louis-Philippe à abdiquer et à quitter le territoire pour la Grande-Bretagne. La reine Victoria met à sa disposition le château de Claremont (dans le Surrey) où il meurt deux ans plus tard, le 26 août 1850. Pour les colonies, la chute de la Monarchie de Juillet et l’instauration du Gouvernement provisoire de la IIe République par la Révolution de février 1848 à Paris précipitent la proclamation de l’abolition de l’esclavage.

He was undoubtedly one of the signatories of a letter addressed to Governor Donzelot in December 1823 by the white Creoles of the north of the island, which insisted on their opposition to any modification of colonial legislation while refusing to grant equality to free of color. Any concession to the latter, they argues, was doomed to failure. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">\"Jean Baptiste DUVAL DUGUE,\"  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Geneanet</tei-emph> , https://gw.geneanet.org/theodoremilie?n=duval+dugue&amp;oc=&amp;p=jean+baptiste</tei-bibl>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Jean-Baptiste Duval Dugue (ou Dugué), blanc créole de la Martinique né à la Grande Anse (Lorrain) le 23 janvier 1791, il décède le 23 août 1858 au Macouba.

Il est qualifié de “propriétaire” dans son arbre généalogique et possède à son décès une habitation sucrerie La Potiche au Macouba. Il a sans doute fait partie des signataires d’une lettre adressée au gouverneur Donzelot en décembre 1823 par les créoles blancs du nord de l’île qui insiste sur leur opposition à toute modification de la législation coloniale tout en refusant de consentir l’égalité aux libres de couleur.

Following his family's tradition, he embarked on a military career, eventually becoming a cavalry officer.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Upon learning of the unrest in the English colonies of North America, Lafayette joined the rebels, using his substantial personal wealth to fund the war effort. His involvement in the war earned him a heroic reputation on both sides of the Atlantic. He was involved in the discussions that led to the Treaty of Paris in 1783 and was later appointed field marshal by Louis XVI. Known for his progressive views, he was one of the few nobles to take the oath at the Jeu de Paume during the Estates-General of 1789, signaling the start of the French Revolution. In the days that followed, he penned the original draft Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lafayette was appointed commander of the National Guard, but his popularity waned during the Constituent Assembly due to his moderate stance. Criticized by the royalists and branded a traitor by the Assembly, he was forced into exile in August 1792 and immediately captured. After enduring years of imprisonment and exile, he returned to France in 1800. He generally concealed his opposition to Napoleon, avoiding politics for most of his reign. After Napoleon's escape from Elba, Lafayette was elected to the Chamber of Deputies during the early Restoration and during Napoleon’s short-lived return. Lafayette played a crucial role in securing Napoleon's second abdication. Under Louis XVIII, Lafayette led the left-wing opposition. Following a year-long tour of the United States between 1824 and 1825, he resumed his role in the democratic opposition during Charles X's reign. He was also a leading figure in the July Revolution of 1830, publicly backing Louis-Philippe and aiding in the establishment of a parliamentary monarchy. However, Lafayette soon grew disenchanted with the new regime as it quickly turned autocratic. He died of pneumonia in 1834 after attending the funeral of François-Charles Dulong, a far-left deputy who was killed in a duel by General Thomas Robert Bugeaud.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lafayette's obituary, published in the inaugural issue of the Revue des Colonies, highlighted his commitment to abolitionism, which appears to have grown out of his first visit to the United States. In a 1783 letter to George Washington, Lafayette proposed that they jointly purchase a plantation to employ freed slaves. Although Washington did not agree, Lafayette carried out this plan two years later on a plantation in Guyana. He was one of the founding members of the abolitionist Société des Amis des Noirs in France in 1788 and advocated for civil rights for people of color at the Constituent Assembly. Throughout his political career, Lafayette consistently supported abolitionist causes, even radical ones. He served as the lifelong vice-president of the American Colonization Society, frequently spoke out against the illegal slave trade in the French parliament, and expressed his support for Haiti years before France officially recognized the country in 1825.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Étienne Taillemitte, “La Fayette et l’abolition de l’esclavage,”  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">L'esclave et les plantations : de l'établissement de la servitude à son abolition.

Suivant la tradition familiale il poursuit une carrière militaire et devient officier de cavalerie. Informé des troubles agitant les colonies anglaises d’Amérique du Nord, Lafayette rejoint les insurgés, faisant usage de sa colossale fortune personnelle pour soutenir l’effort de guerre. Son engagement fait de lui un héros des deux côtés de l’Atlantique. Il participe aux discussions menant au Traité de Paris en 1783, et se voit nommé maréchal de camp par Louis XVI. Connu pour ses convictions progressistes, il est un des rares représentants de la noblesse à prêter serment au Jeu de Paume aux États-Généraux de 1789. Il rédige dans les journées qui suivent le premier jet de la Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Nommé à la tête de la Garde Nationale, Lafayette perd en popularité durant la Constituante du fait de sa position modérée. Décrié par les royalistes et déclaré traître à la nation à l’Assemblée, il s’exile en août 1792. De retour en France en 1800, après des années d’emprisonnement et d’exil, son opposition à Napoléon reste silencieuse jusqu’aux Cent Jours; élu à la Chambre, il joue un rôle clé dans la seconde abdication. Il devient chef de file de l’opposition de gauche sous Louis XVIII. Après une tournée triomphale aux États-Unis entre 1824 et 1825, il reprend son rôle dans l’opposition démocratique aux velléités absolutistes de Charles X. Au premier rang de la révolution de Juillet, il apporte soutien à Louis-Philippe, contribuant à faire accepter la monarchie parlementaire. La rapide dérive autocratique du nouveau régime pousse Lafayette de nouveau dans l’opposition. Il meurt d’une pneumonie en 1834, après avoir assisté à l’enterrement de François-Charles Dulong, député d’extrême-gauche tué en duel par le général Bugeaud.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">La nécrologie de Lafayette publiée dans le premier numéro de la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title> souligne l’engagement abolitionniste de l’homme d’état, qui semble dater de sa visite aux États-Unis. Une lettre à George Washington datant de 1783, le montre essayant de convaincre le général américain de se joindre à lui pour acquérir une plantation qui emploierait des affranchis. Si Washington n’en fit rien, Lafayette mit ce projet en place deux années plus tard, dans une plantation de Guyane. Il fut parmi les premiers membres de la Société des Amis des Noirs, fondée en France en 1788, et se prononça à la Constituante en faveur des droits civiques pour les gens de couleur. La carrière politique de Lafayette sera caractérisée jusque dans les dernières années de sa vie par un des prises de position en soutien aux efforts abolitionnistes, modérés comme radicaux. Il deviendra notamment vice-président à vie de l’American Colonization Society, combattra la traite clandestine, et se positionnera en soutien à Haïti avant même que le pays ne soit officiellement reconnu par la France.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Étienne Taillemitte, « La Fayette et l’abolition de l’esclavage »,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">L'esclave et les plantations : de l'établissement de la servitude à son abolition.

The son of Régis Dessalles and Manon d’Albis de Gissac, he married Anna Bence de Sainte-Catherine, a white Creole from Le Lamentin, in Fort-Royal, the administrative capital of the Martinique colony on October 6, 1808.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Despite his metropolitan origin, Pierre Dessalles became the epitome of a white settler due to his family background and marital alliance. He pursued a career in the judiciary as a counselor at the Court of Appeal of Martinique, initially as an assessor on January 4, 1809, and later as a full counselor on January 4, 1812. In this capacity, he played a role in the Bissette case (1823-1824), securing the conviction of Cyrille Auguste Bissette to life imprisonment with hard labor and branding with the letters GAL (Galley Slave).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Subsequently, he assumed the role of counselor at the Royal Court of Martinique on October 5, 1828, and also held the position of captain in the colony's militias starting from February 25, 1829. However, his tenure as interim Attorney General at the Court of Appeal, which began on June 16, 1831, was short-lived, as he resigned on July 31 of the same year, was suspended on August 4, 1832, and ultimately dismissed on September 19, 1832.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Beyond his legal career, Pierre Dessalles owned plantations, sugar refineries, and coffee estates in Sainte-Marie, a town in the north Atlantic region of Martinique. Familiar with intricacies of Martinique’s colonial slave society, he explored the subject in his book “Life of a Settler in Martinique in the 19th Century” (1808-1856). This publication explored significant events such as the uprisings of enslaved people in 1811 and 1831, the Bissette affair of 1823-1824, the Grande Anse affair of 1833, and the early stages of the abolition of slavery in Martinique.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Henri de Frémont,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Histoire et généalogie de la famille Dessalles ou Des Salles</tei-title> ,  <tei-ref target=\"\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">https://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?lang=fr&amp;p=pierre&amp;n=dessalles&amp;oc=3</tei-ref> .</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Abel Alexis Louis,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Marchands et négociants de couleur à Saint-Pierre (1777-1830) : milieux socioprofessionnels, fortune et mode de vie</tei-title> , Paris, L’Harmattan, 2015.</tei-bibl>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Né à Castillonnès dans le département du Lot-et-Garonne, il décède le 5 mars 1857 à Brest à l’âge de 71 ans. Pierre François Marie Dieudonné Dessalles, plus connu en tant que Pierre Dessalles, était le fils de Régis Dessalles et de Manon d’Albis de Gissac. Marié le 6 octobre 1808 à Fort-Royal, capitale administrative de la colonie de la Martinique, à Anna Bence de Sainte-Catherine, blanche créole du Lamentin, Pierre Dessalles, bien que métropolitain, fut l’archétype du colon blanc par sa famille paternelle et maternelle, ainsi que par son alliance matrimoniale. Il fit une carrière dans la magistrature en tant que conseiller à la Cour d’appel de la Martinique (assesseur le 4 janvier 1809, titulaire le 4 janvier 1812). C’est à ce titre qu’il prit part à l’affaire Bissette (1823-1824) et fit condamner Cyrille Auguste Bissette aux galères à perpétuité et à être marqué au fer rouge des lettres GAL (Galérien). Puis, il fut conseiller à la Cour royale de la Martinique le 5 octobre 1828. Il fut aussi capitaine dans les milices de la colonie le 25 février 1829. Nommé ensuite procureur général par intérim à la Cour d’appel le 16 juin 1831, il fut démissionnaire le 31 juillet suivant, suspendu le 4 août 1832, et destitué le 19 septembre 1832. L’homme fut aussi propriétaire d’habitations, sucrerie et caféière à Sainte-Marie, commune du nord atlantique de la Martinique.

Coming from a family of farmers, this lawyer published several essays in 1823 and 1828 dedicated to the abolition of slavery. He co-founded the French Society for the Abolition of Slavery and was renowned for his numerous speeches in the Chamber of Deputies advocating for the abolition of slavery.

The lawyer's role in the affair of the deportees from Martinique (1823-1824) initially forged bonds, but these weakened over the years. The proposals made by the abolitionist during the 1830s did not appear to satisfy Cyrille Bissette, who grew increasingly critical. Isambert, for his part, distanced himself from the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue des Colonies</tei-emph> and Bissette, criticizing \"the violence and the personalities that dominate it.\" The final break seems to have occurred in 1841, over a matter involving \"the honor of a woman,\" about which Isambert preferred to remain silent.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Isambert, François,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Lettre de M.

Issu d’une famille de cultivateurs, cet avocat publie, en 1823 et 1828, plusieurs mémoires consacrés à l’abolition de l’esclavage. Il est le cofondateur de la Société française pour l'abolition de l'esclavage et s'illustre dans ses nombreuses prises de parole à la Chambre des députés pour demander l'abolition de l'esclavage. Il se fait par ailleurs le mandataire des libres de couleur.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Ses relations avec Cyrille Bissette évoluent au fil du temps. Le rôle de l'avocat dans l'affaire des déportés de la Martinique (1823-1824) crée des liens, qui s'affaiblissent au cours des années. Les propositions formulées par l'abolitionniste dans les années 1830 ne semblent pas satisfaire Cyrille Bissette, qui se montre critique. Isambert, de son côté, se tient à distance de la <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue des Colonies</tei-emph> et de Bissette. Il dénonce « la violence et les personnalités qui y règnent ». La rupture semble scellée en 1841, autour d'une histoire qui engageait « l'honneur d'une femme » et sur laquelle Isambert préfère garder le secret.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Isambert, François,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Lettre de M.

Though there is no historical consensus on his date of birth, Toussaint Louverture (as he eventually came to be known) was born sometime in the early 1740s on the Bréda plantation near the village of Haut-du-Cap in northern Saint Domingue. A creole—that is, born in the colony and not in Africa—he was known in his early years as Toussaint Bréda, after the name of his plantation owner. He rose to the position of coachmen to the manager of the Bréda plantation and, eventually, obtained his emancipation. Archival records reveal him to be legally emancipated by 1776 and a slaveowner himself, renting a coffee plantation from his son-in-law where none other than Jean-Jacques Dessalines was among the enslaved laborers. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">During the revolutionary period, Louverture joined early on with the insurgents Biassou and Jean-François who were backed by the Spanish crown. In 1794, he ended his alliance with the Spanish and proclaimed his allegiance with the French Republic. Louverture ascended the ranks of the army in Saint-Domingue, becoming brigadier-general in 1795, governor-general in 1796, and in 1797, commander-in-chief of the Saint-Domingue army. In 1800, he defeated rival southern general André Rigaud in a civil war known as the War of Knives, unifying French Saint-Domingue under his control and, briefly, the eastern side of the island. In 1801, he promulgated a constitution for Saint-Domingue that maintained the territory’s colonial status and elevated him to Governor-for-life.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When the Leclerc expedition arrived on the northern shore of the island in early 1802, Louverture challenged its legitimacy refused officers’ entry to the island. He and his troops resisted; he was declared an outlaw and, eventually, agreed to surrender and retire from government. This was not enough for Bonaparte who had Leclerc trick, capture, and deport Louverture. He spent his final days imprisoned in the Fort de Joux in the Jura Mountains. He petitioned Bonaparte to grant him a military tribunal to clear his name and end his unlawful imprisonment. His <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">mémoire </tei-emph>and letters went unanswered. Louverture died in prison on April 7, 1803. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bénot, Yves and Dorigny, Marcel, eds.,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Rétablissement de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises. </tei-emph> <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Aux origines de Haïti</tei-emph>   .

Sa date de naissance demeure incertaine, mais il voit le jour au début des années 1740 sur l’habitation Bréda, près du Haut-du-Cap, dans le nord de Saint-Domingue. Créole — c’est-à-dire né dans la colonie et non en Afrique — il est d’abord connu sous le nom de Toussaint Bréda, en référence au domaine où il grandit. Il accède au poste de cocher du régisseur de l’habitation avant d’obtenir son affranchissement. Les archives attestent de son émancipation légale en 1776 et de son statut ultérieur de propriétaire d’esclaves, exploitant une plantation de café louée à son gendre, où Jean-Jacques Dessalines figure parmi les travailleurs asservis.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lorsque la Révolution éclate, Louverture rejoint les insurgés Biassou et Jean-François, soutenus par la couronne espagnole. En 1794, il rompt cette alliance et se rallie à la République française. Il gravit rapidement les échelons de l’armée de Saint-Domingue, devenant général de brigade en 1795, gouverneur général en 1796, puis commandant en chef des forces de l’île en 1797. En 1800, il défait André Rigaud lors de la guerre civile connue sous le nom de <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Guerre des Couteaux</tei-emph>, unifiant Saint-Domingue sous son autorité et prenant brièvement le contrôle de sa partie orientale. En 1801, il promulgue une constitution qui maintient le territoire sous statut colonial tout en le désignant gouverneur à vie.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lorsque l’expédition Leclerc débarque sur les côtes nord de l’île en 1802, Louverture en conteste la légitimité et refuse aux officiers français l’accès au territoire. Ses troupes opposent une résistance farouche, mais il est déclaré hors-la-loi. Après plusieurs mois de combats, il accepte de se rendre et de se retirer de la vie politique. Cette reddition ne suffit pas à Bonaparte, qui ordonne à Leclerc de le capturer et de le déporter. Louverture est emprisonné au Fort de Joux, dans les montagnes du Jura, où il passe ses derniers mois. Il adresse plusieurs lettres à Bonaparte, demandant un tribunal militaire pour défendre son honneur et contester sa détention arbitraire. Ses requêtes restent sans réponse. Il meurt en captivité le 7 avril 1803.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bénot, Yves et Dorigny, Marcel, eds.,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Rétablissement de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises. </tei-emph> <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Aux origines de Haïti</tei-emph>   .

From this family name, there were variants and branch names like Perrinelle-Dumay. Perhaps it was Louis Nicolas Honoré Perrinelle-Dumay (1770-1858), Councilor and Président of the Royal Court of Martinique, or perhaps it is Louis Perrinelle-Dumay, born in 1801, licensed in law in 1821, hearing officer the same year at the Royal Court of Martinique. He is one of the nine titular advisors of this court judging Cyrille Bissette during the case bearing his name. His name appears at the bottom of the judgment of January 12, 1824 rendered by the Royal Court  against Bissette and his co-defendants. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Pâme, Stella.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Cyrille Bissette: un martyr de la liberté</tei-title> .

He likely did his first apprenticeships with teachers color in Fort-Royal He continued his university studies in mainland France and earned his medical degree from the faculty of Paris in 1834. He married Jeanne-Rose Patterson in Castries (St Lucia) on June 24, 1840. It is probable he found it easier to practice medicine in Saint Lucia than on his native island.

A member of Parliament for over two decades, he actively campaigned against slavery under the July Monarchy. He was a founding member of the French Society for the Abolition of Slavery in 1834, of which he later became president. He also sat on the commission on slavery and the colonies chaired by the abolitionist Victor de Broglie between 1840 and 1843. He briefly served as Minister of the Navy and Colonies under the Second Republic, putting an end to his political career after Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte’s coup of December 2, 1851. Like the better-known Victor Schœlcher, Destutt de Tracy also campaigned against capital punishment.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Jennings, Lawrence C.,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">La France et l’abolition de l’esclavage (1802-1848)</tei-title>  , Bruxelles, André Versaille, 2010.</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Schmidt, Nelly.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Abolitionnistes de l'esclavage et réformateurs des colonies, 1820-1851: analyses et documents</tei-title> .

In official documents, he referred to himself as a “mulatto”. Fabien established a successful career as a merchant, further supported by 43,800 pounds acquired in his 1819 marriage to Marie Elisabeth Justine Rogemont, a fellow free person of color whose father owned a valuable sugar refinery in Le Francois. The couple’s significant estate included enslaved people. Fabien fils was arrested in December 1823, alongside Cyrille Bissette, Jean-Baptiste Volny and others for allegedly distributing a pamphlet on the situation of free people of color, demanding civil and political equality with white colonists. In 1824, the group was convicted, branded with hot irons, and sentenced to lifetime imprisonment before this punishment was ultimately reduced to banishment from the colonies. In Paris, Fabien fils gained prominence as an activist alongside Mondesir Richard, taking part in the founding of the Société des hommes de couleur, which advocated for the rights of free people of color in the colonies. He subsequently worked with Bissette on the Revue des Colonies while authoring numerous political pamphlets. He died in 1852 in St. Pierre after having fallen out with Bissette toward the end of his life.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                    <tei-strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-28846eef-7fff-5788-9c4a-bc27d23c19da\" data-origname=\"strong\" data-origatts=\"id\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Louis, Abel Alexis,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Les libres de couleur en Martinique.

Il est lui-même qualifié de mulâtre dans les actes d’état civil et/ou de notariat. Exerçant la profession de marchand, voire même de négociant, et jouissant d’une certaine aisance économique car apportant 43.800 livres coloniales dans son contrat de mariage le 16 février 1819, il fut aussi propriétaire de maisons et d’esclaves et s’unit en outre à Marie Elisabeth Justine Rogemont, métisse libre, descendante de “Caraïbe” par son père, propriétaire pour un quart d’une habitation sucrerie au François d’une valeur de 120.000 livres coloniales. Louis Fabien fils est arrêté en décembre 1823 avec Cyrille Bissette et Jean-Baptiste Volny notamment pour avoir introduit en Martinique et colporté une brochure ou libelle sur la situation des gens de couleur libres demandant l’égalité civile et politique pour ceux-ci avec les blancs. Partageant le sort de Bissette et de Volny, il est condamné comme eux en janvier 1824 au marquage au fer rouge et au bagne à perpétuité, puis, libéré avec une peine de bannissement des colonies françaises. Fabien fils est l’un des fondateurs à Paris de la Société des hommes de couleur en 1832. De la lutte pour l’égalité des libres de couleur des Antilles françaises, Fabien fils, comme Bissette, devient ensuite au cours des années 1832-1835, l’un des principaux militants pour l’abolition immédiate de l’esclavage, aux côtés de Mondésir Richard notamment.

In 1789, 90% of its population of almost half a million consisted of enslaved people, who produced three quarters of the world's sugar.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The mass uprisings of enslaved people that began there 1791 prompted the proclamation of local emancipation in 1793, followed by legislative elections in which the newly enfranchised took part, electing deputies Mills, Dufaÿ, and Belley, the first Black parliamentarian, to represent the colony in the National Convention. In Paris, these deputies encourage the Convention to decree complete and immediate abolition in all French colonies on February 4, 1794. Saint-Domingue was then governed by the formerly enslaved general Toussaint Louverture, who sought to guarantee the autonomy of the colony by drafting a constitution emancipating it from metropolitan institutions. In 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte, as First Consul, ordered the reconquest of the colony and the reestablishment of slavery. When Louverture is imprisoned, his second, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, takes the lead of the revolutionary movement and imposed, on January 1, 1804, the independence of the former colony under the Arawak name of Haiti. In 1825, President Jean-Baptiste Boyer had King Charles X recognize its legitimacy, at the cost of an indemnity of 150 million francs, effectively suffocating the country's economy.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">That the first total abolition of slavery occured in response to slave insurrections is a testament to the importance and agency of enslaved people within the global struggle for abolition. Anticipating the arguments of twentieth-century historians, the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue </tei-title>presents the Haitian Revolution as a true and lasting embodiment of the universalist principles of the French Revolution, even as the violence through which it was accomplished and the political instability that followed were regularly wielded as arguments in favor of the maintenance of slavery in the French colonies, the British colonies, and the United States. The <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue</tei-title>’s characterization of Haiti as a kind of countermodel to the exploitative and prejudiced nations of Europe is thus among its most radical editorial positions.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Brickhouse, Anna.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Transamerican Literary Relations and Nineteenth-Century Public Sphere</tei-title> , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Daut, Marlene.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Tropics of Haiti: Race and the Literary History of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World, 1789-1865</tei-title> .

Saint-Domingue est alors gouvernée par Toussaint Louverture, ancien affranchi, qui souhaite garantir l’autonomie de l’île en élaborant une constitution qui l’émancipe des institutions métropolitaines. En 1802, le Napoléon Bonaparte, à titre de Premier Consul, ordonne la reconquête de la colonie et le rétablissement de l’esclavage. À l’incarcération de Louverture, son second, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, prend la tête du mouvement révolutionnaire pour imposer, le 1er janvier 1804, l’indépendance de l’ancienne colonie sous le nom arawak d’Haïti.

The port city sits deep in the Gulf of Gonâve, between the northern mountains and southern peninsula. It was not always the capital: during the colonial period, the northern port city of Cap Français (now Cap-Haïtien) served as the colony’s center of power until 1770. It was not always called Port-au-Prince, either: during the first French Republic in Saint-Domingue it was renamed “Port Républicain,” and returned briefly to that name once again after the 1843 revolution in Haiti. It earned another nickname “Port-aux-Crimes,” after a republican faction assassinated Jean-Jacques Dessalines in 1806. Indeed, Dessalines had not kept the seat of power in the port capital but rather in Marchand-Dessalines, located north and inland in the Artibonite Valley. Alexandre Pétion returned the capital of the Haitian Republic to Port-au-Prince during the civil war with Henry Christophe’s state-turned-monarchy in the north. Jean-Pierre Boyer unified the two regions under his republic in Port-au-Prince after Christophe’s death in 1820, though separatist regimes and even presidencies challenged the dominance of Port-au-Prince throughout the nineteenth century. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Corvington, Georges,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Port-au-Prince au cours des ans</tei-title>  , vols. 1–3.

Son nom a également changé au fil des régimes : sous la première République française à Saint-Domingue, elle devient Port-Républicain, un nom qu’elle reprend brièvement après la révolution de 1843.

French presence in the region dated to the early seventeenth century, though wars in Europe led to British takeover and occupation of Saint-Louis from 1759 to 1779 and 1807-1817, and of Gorée from 1758 to 1763, 1779-1783, and 1800-1817. Negotiations with the British at the end of the Napoleonic Wars allowed the French to reclaim control of Senegal in 1817. After 1817, French authorities began to broaden their aims beyond maritime trade to include a wider range of activities. This was evident in the creation of Senegal's first French public schools and hospital, often with assistance from Catholic missionary orders, in the 1810s and 1820s, and perhaps most clearly in agricultural colonization projects. Signing a treaty with the ruler of the Waalo kingdom in 1819, Governor Julien Schmaltz gained land use rights to a parcel along the Senegal River and the right to build a fort at Dagana. During Baron Jacques-François Roger’s tenure as governor (1822-1827), the agricultural project on this parcel, known as Richard Toll, received a lot of attention. Though the Ministry of the Marine and French administration in Senegal admitted by the early 1830s that Richard Toll had failed, it signaled an increasing and ongoing interest in affairs along the Senegal River, which continued into the 1830s and 1840s, and found a place in the pages of Bissette's publication. Bissette also included articles critical of Governor Germain's decision to involve French troops in a war in Waalo from 1833 to 1835, aimed at preventing Waalo from securing an alliance with the Trarzas Moors to the north, and articles on the aftermath of this conflict.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Populations of both Saint-Louis and Gorée included a very small community of metropolitan French people (officials, traders and representatives of merchant firms, missionaries, and others), free Africans who worked as traders, fishermen, sailors, craftsmen, or day laborers; métis or mixed-race people (born to African or mixed women known as signares and French fathers, and their descendants), and--until 1848--a large population of enslaved Africans. Efforts to develop agriculture notwithstanding, commerce dominated the economy, with gum Arabic as the primary export during the period immediately after France’s abolition of the transatlantic slave trade (1815). Later in the nineteenth century, groundnuts or peanuts would come to dominate Senegal’s export trade.</tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Place\" resp=\"#kelly\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">À l’époque de la <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue</tei-emph>, la colonie française du Sénégal se limite aux villes marchandes insulaires de Saint-Louis et Gorée, ainsi qu’à quelques avant-postes, certains fortifiés, le long du fleuve Sénégal et au sud de Gorée. La présence française dans la région remonte au début du XVIIe siècle, bien que les guerres en Europe entraînent l’occupation et le contrôle de Saint-Louis par les Britanniques de 1759 à 1779 et de 1807 à 1817, et de Gorée de 1758 à 1763, de 1779 à 1783, et de 1800 à 1817. Les négociations avec les Britanniques à la fin des guerres napoléoniennes permettent à la France de reprendre le contrôle du Sénégal en 1817.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Après 1817, les autorités françaises élargissent leurs ambitions au-delà du commerce maritime, en s’engageant dans une gamme d’activités plus variées. Cela se manifeste notamment par la création des premières écoles publiques françaises et d’un hôpital au Sénégal, souvent avec l’aide des ordres missionnaires catholiques, dans les années 1810 et 1820. Ces efforts sont particulièrement visibles dans les projets de colonisation agricole. En signant un traité avec le souverain du royaume du Waalo en 1819, le gouverneur Julien Schmaltz obtient des droits d’usage foncier sur une parcelle le long du fleuve Sénégal ainsi que le droit de construire un fort à Dagana. Sous le mandat du baron Jacques-François Roger, gouverneur de 1822 à 1827, le projet agricole sur cette parcelle, connue sous le nom de Richard Toll, reçoit une attention particulière. Bien que le ministère de la Marine et l’administration française au Sénégal admettent dès le début des années 1830 l’échec de Richard Toll, ce projet marque un intérêt croissant et continu pour les affaires le long du fleuve Sénégal, qui se poursuit dans les années 1830 et 1840 et trouve écho dans les pages de la publication de Bissette.

Malgré les efforts de développement agricole, le commerce domine l’économie, avec la gomme arabique comme principal produit d’exportation dans la période suivant immédiatement l’abolition par la France de la traite transatlantique (1815).

According to the 1788 census, Cayenne’s enslaved population represented just over 80% of the total population. During the Revolution, Cayenne received multiple convoys of exiles from metropolitan France, beginning its eventual transformation into a penal colony in the nineteenth century. The 1794 abolition decree was never meaningfully enforced there. Victor Hugues, the commissioner in charge of enforcing the decree in Guadeloupe, was named governor of Guiana in 1799, replacing slavery with a system of conscripted labor until the official restoration of slavery in 1802 by the decree of First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte. This regression to pre-Revolutionary conditions led to high frequencies of marronage. Conquered by Portuguese forces in 1809, the colony was returned to France in 1817, following the Treaty of Paris.

Issue du premier empire colonial français, voisine du Brésil et du Suriname, cette colonie fondée sur l’économie de plantation devient un lieu de déportation lors de la Révolution française, accueillant plusieurs convois de proscrits. D’après le recensement de 1788, la population esclavisée y représente un peu plus de 80% de la population. L’abolition de l’esclavage, en application du décret de la Convention, y est proclamée le 14 juin 1794. En 1802, Victor Hugues, le commissaire chargé de faire appliquer le décret d’abolition de l’esclavage en Guadeloupe, y impose le rétablissement de l’esclavage promulgué en 1802 par Napoléon Bonaparte, Premier Consul, et instaure un régime de conscription locale.

In 1833, British Parliament proclaimed the abolition of slavery, to be enacted in 1834, culminating in the effective emancipation of all enslaved people in the British colonies by 1838, after a period of “apprenticeship.” The process of British abolition, which occurred in parallel to the first years of publication of the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue</tei-title>, signaled the inevitability of abolition in France, shifting the debate to the question of immediate or gradualist emancipation.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Like other French abolitionists, Bissette received confirmed support from the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society </tei-title>(BFASS), at least for the publication of his short-lived <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue Abolioniste </tei-title>in 1847.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Jennings, Lawrence C. “Slavery and the Venality of the July Monarchy Press.”  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">French Historical Studies</tei-title>  17.4 (1992): 957–78.</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Walvin, James. \"British Abolitionism, 1787-1838.\" In  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">The Abolitions of Slavery: From the LF Sonthonax to Victor Schoelcher, 1793, 1794, 1848</tei-title> ,edited by Marcel Dorigny (New York: Bergham Books, 2003), 71-78</tei-bibl>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Place\" resp=\"#masha\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">À la fois puissance militaire et coloniale rivale de la France et modèle du mouvement abolitionniste français, l’Angleterre bénéficie, au sein de la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue, </tei-title>d’une couverture médiatique particulièrement intéressante.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Adversaire de la France pendant la période révolutionnaire et napoléonienne, la Grande-Bretagne saisit et restitue à plusieurs reprises diverses possessions coloniales françaises.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Quelque peu freiné, dans les années 1790, par les craintes que suscitent les Révolution française et haïtienne, le mouvement abolitionniste britannique se popularise à partir de 1807, sous la double perspective de l’immoralité du maintien de l’esclavage et l’intérêt économique de son abolition.

Renamed Réunion during the Revolution, then Bonaparte Island under the Empire, it was occupied by the British between 1810 and 1814, before definitively returning to France in the Treaty of Paris. First used as a stopover for the ships of the French East India Company, the island adopted a slave plantation economy in the first half of the eighteenth century. According to the 1788 census, approximately 80% of the island’s population, originating in Africa, Madagascar or India, was enslaved. The abolition decreed by the Convention on February 4, 1794 was never actually applied and acts of resistance, notably <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">marronage</tei-title>, were common.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As is in other colonial territories, the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title> maintained a distributor and a correspondent there responsible for reporting on the island’s current events. However, the circulation of the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue</tei-title> was hampered by the local administration, who considered the publication seditious. Thus, in a letter dated May 1836, Louis-Timagène Houat, himself imprisoned, along with other men of color, for incitement to insurrection, offered to take over from the previous correspondent, who had been the victim of such intimidation.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Ève, Prosper.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Naître et mourir à l’île Bourbon à l’époque de l’esclavage</tei-title> .

Devenue Réunion à la Révolution, puis île Bonaparte sous l’Empire, elle est occupée par les Britanniques entre 1810 et 1814, avant d’être définitivement rendue à la France dans le cadre du traité de Paris. D’abord employée comme escale pour les navires de la Compagnie française des Indes orientales, l’île intègre, dans la première moitié du 18e siècle, le modèle de la société de plantation esclavagiste. D’après le recensement de 1788, environ 80% de la population de l’île, d’origine africaine, malgache, ou indienne, est esclavisée. L’esclavagisme bourbonnais repose, par ailleurs, sur une politique de division éthnique d’africains, de malgaches et d’indiens dans le but d’éviter la constitution d’un groupe majoritaire menaçant pour l’ordre colonial. L’abolition décrétée par la Convention le 4 février 1794, n’y est jamais appliquée et les actes de résistance, notamment le marronnage, sont répandus.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Comme c’est le cas dans d’autres territoires coloniaux, la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies </tei-title>y dispose d’un distributeur et d’un correspondant chargé de rendre compte de l’actualité de l’île.

As a slave economy primarily devoted to sugar cultivation, the island’s enslaved population represented approximately 85% of the total, per the 1789 census, with 13% white and 3% “free people of color.” The archipelago came under British control between 1759 and 1763, and was briefly occupied again in 1794, following the National Convention’s abolition decree. This occupation was, however, expelled by military forces including several thousand newly emancipated men, led by Victor Hugues, the civil commissioner sent by the Convention to enforce the abolition decree. The implementation of this abolition was, however, largely symbolic, with chattel slavery replaced, in many instances, by forced labor. In 1802, a large insurrectionary army commanded by Louis Delgrès, a free man of color, opposed the French General Richepanse, who had been sent to restore slavery on the orders of Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul. The brutally repressed insurrection would end with the suicide of Delgrès and his company.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Guadeloupe again came under British control during the Napoleonic Wars. Briefly ceded to Sweden during the Treaty of Paris in 1814, it definitively returned to French control in 1815. At the time of the foundation of the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title>, the population of free people of color equaled the white population, and owned about a quarter of the land. The <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue</tei-title> gives significant attention to current events in Guadeloupe, likely through the efforts of Mondésir Richard, a “<tei-title data-origname=\"title\">mandataire</tei-title> of the free people of color of Guadeloupe\" and apparent member of the “Society of men of color” who founded the periodical.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Dorigny, Marcel, and Bernard Gainot, eds.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Atlas des esclavages.

The main functions of these colonial councils pertain to the administrative organization and the budget of the colony. More broadly, the members of the colonial councils debate and vote on all matters concerning the internal affairs of the colony. They meet during an annual ordinary session and can be convened for extraordinary sessions by the governor.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Each colony has 30 members, elected for five-year terms through a censitary voting system. Article 21 of the Legislative Regime of the Colonies, dated April 24, 1833, stipulates: “Eligible for the position of a member of the colonial council is any voter aged 30 or older, paying 600 francs in direct contributions in Martinique and Guadeloupe, or 400 francs in Bourbon Island and Guyana, and proving ownership of movable or immovable property in the colony valued at 60,000 francs in Martinique and Guadeloupe, and 40,000 francs in Bourbon Island and Guyana.”  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Free people of color in the colonies, particularly in Martinique, deem this property and tax requirement excessively high. Nevertheless, Eugène Clavier, a sugar planter of color, manages to join the council in 1845. This triggers a controversy within the colony. Tradition dictates that the governor formally invites all representatives of the colony to a dinner at the opening of the session. Governor Mathieu, “yielding,” according to Bissette, “to the suggestions of certain council members” who allegedly stated that they “did not wish to dine at the same table, side by side with a mulatto,” decides not to invite Clavier.  </tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Organization\" resp=\"#jessica\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">La loi du 24 avril 1833 crée les conseils coloniaux, qui succèdent aux conseils généraux, et la tête desquels se trouvent les gouverneurs des colonies.

Negotiations for recognition failed under Dessalines, Pétion and Christophe, as various early independence governments balked at France’s terms and French agents’ continued designs on the land they continue to refer to under the colonial name of Saint-Domingue. President Jean-Pierre Boyer (1818–1843) attempted his own negotiations with France but his hand was ultimately forced when Charles X’s emissary, Baron Mackau, arrived with a military squadron in the harbor of Port-au-Prince with a new ordonnance from the king (dated April 17, 1825). The order stated that Haiti would give France preferential trade status via a reduced customs duty and pay a staggering 150 million francs to compensate French property owners for their “loss.” Boyer signed, under the threat of gunboats, on July 11, 1825.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Boyer’s government immediately took out a loan to make their first payment—borrowing 30 million francs from French banks in order to repay the French government for recognition of their independence. The indemnity agreement and the loans had disastrous consequences for the economic and political autonomy of the nation. Economists have estimated the total cost of the indemnity to Haiti over the last 200 years to be at least $21 billion dollars, perhaps as much as $115 billion.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                    <tei-ref target=\"https://memoire-esclavage.org/lordonnance-de-charles-x-sur-lindemnite-dhaiti\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">https://memoire-esclavage.org/lordonnance-de-charles-x-sur-lindemnite-dhaiti</tei-ref>\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                    <tei-ref target=\"https://esclavage-indemnites.fr/public/Base/1\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">https://esclavage-indemnites.fr/public/Base/1</tei-ref>\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Blancpain, François,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Un siècle de relations financières entre Haïti et la France (1825-1922)</tei-title>  .

Sous Dessalines, Pétion et Christophe, les négociations en ce sens échouent, les premiers gouvernements haïtiens refusant d’accepter les conditions imposées par la France, tandis que les agents français continuent à revendiquer le territoire sous son nom colonial de Saint-Domingue.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Le président Jean-Pierre Boyer (1818–1843) entreprend à son tour des négociations avec la France, mais la situation prend un tournant décisif lorsque l’émissaire de Charles X, le baron Mackau, arrive dans le port de Port-au-Prince à la tête d’une escadre militaire, porteur d’une ordonnance royale datée du 17 avril 1825. Celle-ci stipule qu’Haïti doit accorder à la France un statut commercial préférentiel, par le biais d’une réduction des droits de douane, et verser une indemnité de 150 millions de francs pour compenser les propriétaires français de la « perte » de leurs biens. Sous la pression militaire, Boyer signe l’accord le 11 juillet 1825.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Afin de s’acquitter du premier paiement, son gouvernement contracte immédiatement un emprunt de 30 millions de francs auprès de banques françaises, destiné à financer la somme exigée par le gouvernement français en échange de la reconnaissance officielle de l’indépendance haïtienne.

The law, proposed by First Consul Bonaparte and debated by the assemblies, was adopted on May 20, 1802 (30 floréal an 10).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The pertinent text of the law is as follows:</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Article 1: “Dans les colonies restituées à la France en exécution du traité d’Amiens, du 6 germinal an X, l’esclavage sera maintenu conformément aux lois et réglemens antérieures à 1789.”<tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>Article 3: “La traite des noirs et leur importation des lesdites colonies, auront lieu, conformément aux lois et règlemens existans avant ladite époque de 1789.”</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Slavery had been abolished first in Saint Domingue in 1793 by civil commissioners Leger-Félicité Sonthonax and Étienne Polverel. A committee from Saint-Domingue then sailed to France to urge the government to ratify the 1793 proclamations for all French colonies. On February 4, 1794 the Convention proclaimed slavery abolished throughout the Republic. Though applied in Guadeloupe and, eventually, Guyana, the 1794 decree was not applied in Martinique, Saint Lucia or Tobago (then under British occupation) or in the Indian Ocean colonies (which essentially delayed and refused). The Treaty of Amiens signed March 15, 1802 with Great Britain thus restored to France those colonies that had maintained slavery and the slave trade throughout the period of occupation. The May 20 law did not reestablish slavery throughout the French colonies but was nevertheless a stark retreat from the values of 1789: slavery and the slave trade was now legal in the French Republic. A consular order from July 16, 1802 (27 messidor an X) reestablished slavery in Guadeloupe. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">There is a lack of clarity, both in contemporary scholarship and in the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue</tei-emph>, on the nature of the May 20 decree-law. Scholars often incorrectly cite the law as the date that marks Bonaparte’s reestablishment of slavery throughout the French colonies. Bissette’s exaggerated claim, “Tout le monde sait que la loi de floréal an 10, qui rétablit l’esclavage dans les colonies, fut le signal de la défection de tous les chefs de Saint-Domingue” reveals that this confusion was in place even in 1830s. It also confirms the effectiveness of Bonaparte’s attempts to reestablish slavery under the radar and without fanfare. Nevertheless, Bissette is correct about the consequences of Bonaparte and the Consulate’s pro-slavery machinations in contributing to the anticolonial, antislavery act of Haitian independence. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Niort, Jean-François and Richard, Jérémie, “ A propos de la découverte de l’arrêté consulaire du 16 juillet 1802 et du rétablissement de l’ancien ordre colonial (spécialement de l’esclavage) à la Guadeloupe,”  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Bulletin de la Société d’Histoire de la Guadeloupe</tei-emph>  no. 152 (2009). 31–59. https://doi.org/10.7202/1036868ar</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bénot, Yves and Dorigny, Marcel, eds.,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Rétablissement de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises. </tei-emph> <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Aux origines de Haïti</tei-emph>   .

Le 4 février 1794, la Convention nationale décréta l’abolition de l’esclavage dans l’ensemble de la République. Ce décret fut appliqué en Guadeloupe et, plus tard, en Guyane, mais resta sans effet en Martinique, à Sainte-Lucie et à Tobago, alors sous occupation britannique, ainsi que dans les colonies de l’océan Indien, où son application fut délibérément différée.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Le traité d’Amiens, signé avec la Grande-Bretagne le 15 mars 1802, permit à la France de récupérer plusieurs colonies où l’esclavage et la traite avaient été maintenus sous administration britannique. La loi du 20 mai 1802 ne rétablissait pas formellement l’esclavage dans l’ensemble des territoires français, mais elle marquait une rupture avec les principes de 1789 en entérinant la légalité de l’esclavage et de la traite dans certaines colonies. Quelques mois plus tard, un arrêté consulaire du 16 juillet 1802 (27 messidor an X) confirma explicitement le rétablissement de l’esclavage en Guadeloupe.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Tant l’historiographie contemporaine que la <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue des Colonies</tei-emph> entretiennent une certaine confusion quant à la portée exacte du décret du 20 mai. Nombre d’historiens citent à tort cette loi comme l’acte fondateur du rétablissement de l’esclavage dans toutes les colonies françaises. L’affirmation de Cyrille Bissette—« Tout le monde sait que la loi de floréal an 10, qui rétablit l’esclavage dans les colonies, fut le signal de la défection de tous les chefs de Saint-Domingue »—illustre bien que cette lecture erronée existait déjà dans les années 1830. Elle témoigne également du succès de la stratégie de Bonaparte, qui chercha à rétablir l’esclavage de manière discrète, sans déclaration officielle retentissante. Pourtant, Bissette ne se trompe pas sur les effets des politiques du Consulat : les manœuvres pro-esclavagistes de Bonaparte contribuèrent directement à l’acte d’indépendance haïtien, dont la portée fut à la fois anticoloniale et antiesclavagiste.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">https://memoire-esclavage.org/napoleon-et-le-retablissement-de-lesclavage/lessentiel-dossier-<tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>napoleon-et-le-retablissement-de</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>https://www.portail-esclavage-reunion.fr/documentaires/abolition-de-l-esclavage/l-abolition-de-l-<tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>esclavage-a-la-reunion/la-premiere-abolition-de-lesclavage-par-la-france-et-sa-non-application-<tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>a-la-reunion/</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Niort, Jean-François et Richard, Jérémie, “ A propos de la découverte de l’arrêté consulaire du 16 juillet 1802 et du rétablissement de l’ancien ordre colonial (spécialement de l’esclavage) à la Guadeloupe,”  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Bulletin de la Société d’Histoire de la Guadeloupe</tei-emph>  no. 152 (2009). 31–59. https://doi.org/10.7202/1036868ar</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bénot, Yves et Dorigny, Marcel, eds.,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Rétablissement de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises. </tei-emph> <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Aux origines de Haïti</tei-emph>   .

An important cultural signifier, it was referenced frequently in other publications, in fiction, and likely in contemporary discussions. Its title, derived from the verb <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">monere</tei-emph>, meaning to warn or advise, gestures at Enlightenment and Revolutionary ideals of intelligent counsel.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Initially, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Le Moniteur universel</tei-title> was merely a subtitle of the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Gazette Nationale</tei-title>, established in 1789 by Charles-Joseph Panckouke, who also published Diderot and d’Alembert’s <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Encyclopédie</tei-title>.

Under the Empire, it gained the privilege of publishing government acts and official communications, effectively becoming the Empire's primary propaganda outlet. However, its role was not confined to this function. It survived various political regimes, including the Revolution and the death of Panckouke in 1798. Its longevity can be attributed to its adaptability, with its successive iterations reflecting the political culture of each historical stage, transitioning from an encyclopedic model during the Revolution, to a state propaganda tool during the First Empire, to a collection of political speeches under the constitutional monarchy and the Second Republic, and finally, to a daily opinion newspaper for the general public under Napoleon III.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">During the print run of the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title>, the “Moniteur” was divided into two main sections: the “official” and the “unofficial” part. Government documents and official communications were published in the official section, while other current events and various topics were featured in the unofficial section under a range of headings such as “Domestic,” “International,” “Entertainment,” etc. The texts cited in <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title> were most often found in the unofficial section, typically under the “Domestic” heading and on the front page.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Titles containing the label “Moniteur” followed by a toponym abounded throughout the nineteenth century: local or colonial titles used this formula to emphasize their official status, maintaining the distinction between the official and unofficial sections.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Laurence Guellec, « Les journaux officiels »,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">La Civilisation du journal</tei-title>  (dir.

Ce titre, qui renvoie au langage des Lumières et de la Révolution, dérive étymologiquement du verbe <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">monere</tei-emph>, signifiant avertir ou conseiller. Il n’est d’abord que le sous-titre de la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Gazette nationale</tei-title>, créée en 1789 par Charles-Joseph Panckouke, éditeur entre autres de l’<tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Encyclopédie</tei-title> de Diderot et d’Alembert ; ce n’est qu’en 1811 que le sous-titre, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Le Moniteur universel</tei-title>, devient officiellement titre.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lancé en 1789, ce périodique devient en 1799 l’organe officiel du gouvernement consulaire ; il obtient ensuite, sous l’Empire, le privilège de la publication des actes du gouvernement et des communications officielles, passant de fait au statut d’« organe de propagande cardinal de l’Empire ». Il ne se limite pourtant pas à cette fonction, et survit aux différents régimes politiques comme il a survécu à la Révolution et à la mort de Panckouke en 1798. Sa survie est notamment liée à sa capacité à changer : les modèles adoptés par sa rédaction, qu'ils soient choisis ou imposés par le pouvoir en place, reflètent de manière révélatrice la culture politique propre à chaque période marquante de son histoire. Ainsi, comme le souligne Laurence Guellec, il se transforme en une grande encyclopédie pendant la Révolution, devient un instrument de propagande étatique sous le Premier Empire, se mue en recueil des discours des orateurs durant la monarchie constitutionnelle et la Seconde République, puis se positionne en tant que quotidien grand public et journal d'opinion sous le règne de Napoléon III. Ajoutons enfin que les titres constitués du syntagme « Moniteur » suivi d’un toponyme sont nombreux, au cours du siècle, en France : les titres locaux ou coloniaux adoptent cette formule pour mettre en exergue leur ancrage officiel, et respectent la distinction entre partie officielle et non officielle.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">À l’époque de la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title>, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Le Moniteur universel</tei-title> est organisé en deux grandes parties : la « partie officielle » et la « partie non officielle ».
