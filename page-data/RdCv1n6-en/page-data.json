It is evident that, until, on the one hand, caste prejudices have fallen, and, on the other, the natural resentment born of long oppression has been extinguished, necessity alone will regulate the social relations between men of color and whites. Nevertheless, philosophy and reason, through the unceasing action of a few men of heart and of devotion, will end by showing everyone where evil and error lie, and where truth and remedy are; and, within a span of time surely less distant than some hope and others fear, the work will have become so easy that the all-powerful, maternal impulse of the metropolis alone will suffice to bring it to completion. For it is indeed impossible that, once just grievances have been satisfied, resentments appeased, interests leveled, oppressors disarmed and punished—in a word, rights proclaimed equal and suitably protected by public authority—it is impossible, we say, that the white and Black populations of the colonies should not fraternize and unite in order to cultivate together, to the greatest advantage of all, that land—today their common fatherland—of which a better organization of labor and the development of the eminently social sentiment of human fraternity will make for them a homeland as dear as it is free, industrious, and prosperous. Once slavery is abolished, all these men restored to freedom, initiated through education into the lights and sciences of Europe, so fertile in happy results, will seek—make no doubt of it—in intelligent and free labor sources of prosperity and well-being that may surpass all the calculations of human foresight. Freedom will make of these Blacks, whom their condition alone makes what we see, hardworking laborers, indefatigable cultivators, useful citizens in every branch of<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f4\" n=\"4\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/> human work. What do they lack? freedom and the tools of labor, which one always ends by acquiring once one possesses it; freedom, the first condition of every happy society; freedom, which corrects itself, enlightens its own faults and heals—like Achilles’ spear—the wounds it makes, and which, together with equality, imposes virtue upon man. There lies, for the colonies, the source of their future destinies and of prosperities perhaps unheard-of. “The slave is everywhere indolent, vicious, and abject; the free man is active, virtuous, and enterprising,” said a celebrated American, one of the most illustrious writers of our age. There is the whole secret of the immobility of slave societies and of the immense activity of societies founded on the practical recognition of everyone’s rights. In the former, the slave is indolent, vicious, and abject indeed—and it cannot be otherwise: for him there is neither honor nor advantage in being anything else. Slavery is for him like Dante’s hell: he left all hope behind upon entering. The master is harsh, haughty, cruel, and no less vicious—by position as well—besides being the first and fatal cause of the other’s degradation and of all his vices. Hated, moreover, by the one whom he exploits without pity, his life is a continual apprehension. This is not a free man; he too is a slave—guilty, since he is forced to be a tyrant—locked in perpetual struggle with his conscience or with the perilous necessities of his situation, eternally threatened, and therefore without security or true freedom. Such a social state is intolerable, especially in this century, when freedom and equality are the foundations of public law among all civilized peoples; it is a detestable exception that cannot endure. \n</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">As for the present fusion of the two free classes, the first step toward a better future, as we have already said, it cannot truly take place in the colonies of the Antilles until the government of the metropolis seriously intends to clear away the obstacles that stand in its way—something which today, it cannot be denied, it seems to have only very modestly at heart.\n   </tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We shall point out some of these obstacles, persuaded\nthat publicity can be, in this as in everything, only salutary. The first and greatest is the composition of the royal courts. The members of these courts exercise an unfortunate influence over the mass of the privileged class. If we take as our only example the composition <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f5\" n=\"5\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>of the royal court of the <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, one is convinced that there will never be any possible agreement between the two rival classes. So long as this court is not completely renewed in keeping with the new spirit, so long as magistrates are retained whose obvious interest is to convict in all political accusations, and whose ill will and hateful passions are a matter of public notoriety, there will be neither peace nor truce to hope for between the opposing parties.\n   </tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The poor selection of governors and of the principal authorities, who for the most part go to seek their fortune in the colonies, is also one of the causes that prevent the fusion. In order to remain in their post for as long as possible, the governors ordinarily place themselves at the service of the aristocratic party—called by the whites themselves the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">oligarchy</tei-emph> of the country. These governors, most of them weak, timid, or little educated, often lacking the simplest knowledge in matters of administration and government, are obliged to entrust themselves to schemers sold to the aristocratic party or chosen within this <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">oligarchy</tei-emph>; in reality they are only the responsible publishers of a few influential men who govern as they please and at the whim of their passions.</tei-p>\n\n     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">If the choice of governors were made with generous and forward-looking aims, among men devoted to the true principle of the revolution, the fusion would take place little by little; but to find these men, one must not look for them only within the narrow cadre of the navy’s general officers; the Ministry of the Navy must not yield to the intrigues of the colonial coterie that sits in Paris, that coterie which, all-powerful in the Navy offices—one knows not by what strange influence—makes, unmakes, and remakes at will the governors and everything that pertains to the internal administration of the colonies. It would therefore be fitting, for the purpose we propose, to choose as governor only administrators—enlightened and capable men—seeking above all the common good, and imbued with political principles and sociability whose propagation is so necessary in the colonies. If the governors of the colonies did not themselves display a foolish and stupid prejudice against Blacks and men of color, the colonial aristocracy would yield little by little and its repugnances would disappear.<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f6\" n=\"6\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/></tei-p>\n\n     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">But what have the governors done since the <tei-rs data-origname=\"rs\">July Revolution</tei-rs> to bring about the fusion? Nothing. In the <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, after 1830, the theater had become accessible to men of color as to whites; but, in order to avoid contact between whites and mulattoes, the director was paid a sum of 20,000 francs so that he would not perform. This sum was taken from the treasury, and yet men of color pay the tax just like whites. At the same moment, authorization was formally refused to young men of color to stage bourgeois comedy and to have an amateur theater society—an authorization that some men of color had the simplicity to request. Later, dramatic artists open a show, but entry this time is refused to men of color, on the pretext that it is a subscription-based private theater (1). They are driven from the church at certain solemnities where whites alone are admitted.</tei-p>\n\n     <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In the <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName>, men of color have been turned away from cafés to make room for whites alone, and the authorities have converted these public establishments into private gatherings in order to exclude mulattoes. Fights ensue; the young men of color are driven back with brutality by armed force; they are arrested and imprisoned.</tei-p>\n\n      <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Local ordinances that prevented men of color, in the <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, from appearing on certain promenades reserved for whites were abolished by the July Revolution. But the aristocracy of that colony resisted, and men of color were forced to come to blows with it in order to win such a right. Is that not incredible?</tei-p>\n\n      <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Despite the ordinances that grant the qualification of sieur and dame—until now refused to men of color in public acts—the authorities resisted for a long time to comply with this formula of politeness. It took explicit orders from the Minister of the Navy to overcome the ill will of ministerial officers and of the civil registry. </tei-p>\n\n       <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The aristocracy has rejected primary education established in the colonies of the <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName> and of the <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName>. The governors yielded to this demand of the colonists, who do not want there to<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f7\" n=\"7\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n3) See no. 5 of the revue des colonies, page 43\nopen schools for the oppressed classes: the directors sent from <tei-placeName ref=\"#FR\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">France</tei-placeName> by the Minister of the Navy to establish these schools were obliged to leave the colonies.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Administrative officials and European magistrates fraternize with men of color; they receive them at dinner. A governor (his name must be given, to brand him), <tei-persName ref=\"#JHD\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">M. Dupotet</tei-persName>, has these officials deported on the complaint of a Creole prosecutor general. This prosecutor general had, shortly before, carried out a ruling of the royal court that sentenced a poor enslaved woman to the lash for having sung <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">La Parisienne</tei-emph> (1), without the governor placing the slightest obstacle in the way.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Young Creole lawyers and Europeans who want progress in the colonies are paralyzed in their generous efforts; their independence is null before the retrograde party, called <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">oligarchy</tei-emph>. There is no possible future for them if they dare to show themselves men of progress. In their pleadings before the courts, they are constantly obliged to be circumspect, never to plead for a man of color or an enslaved person with that ardor and that momentum of conviction; they must plead only for mitigating circumstances, because the royal court—composed of magistrates who want fusion only with scaffolds and the executioner—calls to order or insolently reprimands the courageous lawyer who dares to plead with conscientious energy. From then on, no future for them—only tedium, persecutions, and disgusts of every kind.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Such are the principal obstacles which, in those French colonies we know most particularly, delay this fusion, which we rightly consider one of the greatest advances that can be accomplished there. Sincerely desiring the union and fraternity of the two races in the colonies, however great our confidence may otherwise be in the near and universal triumph of philosophy and reason, it is painful to us—and we lament with good cause—to see the government of the metropolis do so little to hasten this triumph in lands where its action could be exercised in so direct and so decisive a manner.\n(1) This punishment was carried out by the executioner. To flog a woman naked in the public square—such are the mores of our colonies.<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f8\" n=\"8\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n</tei-p>\n</tei-div>\n<tei-div data-origname=\"div\">\n<tei-head n=\"L'esclavage de nos colonies est plus dur et plus inhumain que celui d'aucun peuple de l'antiquité.\" data-origname=\"head\" data-origatts=\"n\">SLAVERY IN OUR COLONIES IS HARSHER AND MORE INHUMANE THAN THAT OF ANY PEOPLE OF ANTIQUITY.</tei-head>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The most general and most ordinary cause of slavery among the ancient peoples was war. The law of nations of that period allowed the victor to dispose of his prisoners. Instead of taking their lives, he preserved them on the condition that they serve him. Slavery was thus only the ransom of life. Since the chances had been equal, and the fortune of arms alone had decided, the vanquished submitted to his condition with less repugnance; it was a consolation for his misfortune: his master, for the same reason, lightened the weight of his servitude.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Slaves, being subjected to the harshest despotism—the kind that weighs of one individual upon his fellow—have at all times been condemned to satisfy in turn the pride, avarice, insolence, and cruelty of their masters. Some, however, enjoyed a gentler lot, depending on the character of their masters or the civilization of the people among whom they lived.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Among the Egyptians, for example, the laws interposed their salutary mediation between the master’s fury and the oppressed slave; they severely punished attempts against his life. The temple of Hercules was constantly open to slaves, who sought there an asylum against the persecutions of their masters.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The lawgiver of the Jews was more favorable still to slaves. He made gentleness toward them an obligation. He ordained that ill-treatment should be a sufficient cause for the emancipation of slaves. Under the law of that people, a man’s slavery could last only until the sabbatical year, so that he could not be a slave for more than six years and often much less,</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The gentle mores of the Athenians—their civilization, their enlightenment—made them worthy to give Europe examples of humanity toward slaves, just as they gave it their masterpieces in the liberal arts. The law among them had fixed the price of emancipations and given slaves means to accumulate savings that would allow them to buy themselves back. Emancipation was also their reward for services rendered to private individuals or to the republic.<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f9\" n=\"9\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Did a master push his power to the point of barbarity? <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Athens</tei-placeName> had a temple dedicated to Theseus, where slaves could take refuge until the magistrate had ruled on the offense of which they complained. Slaves could also bring suits in their own name against citizens who had caused them some wrong; in a word, they enjoyed all the privileges inseparable from good laws in a country where justice and love of order were preferred to influence and wealth. Thus there was in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Athens</tei-placeName> only a single slave revolt during the entire duration of the republic; whereas the <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Spartans</tei-persName>, whom a false policy led to mistreat the helots, and who often massacred them solely in order to accustom themselves to blood, more than once ran the greatest danger from the desperate efforts slaves made to recover their liberty.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">So long as the Romans remained faithful to virtue—the true principle and foundation of the republic—they treated their slaves with gentleness. They were just and moderate with them. If they discovered in them seeds of genius, far from taking offense, they sought to develop it by having them instructed in belles lettres and the liberal arts. Such is the education that produced Phaedrus and Terence. These slaves were permitted to devote their leisure to a lucrative trade, and when they had amassed a sum sufficient to buy themselves back, their ransom was never refused.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">A despotic government having succeeded that of a free and generous people, the subjugation of the masters made the yoke of the slaves heavier. It was in that period that gladiatorial combats became the Romans’ favorite spectacle, and that one saw on their stages as many as two thousand slaves or prisoners of war expire at once.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I am reluctant to speak of the servitude of our forefathers. If they were humiliated for a long time, they also bequeathed to all the slaves of the world a great example to follow: they broke their irons, and with the fragments of their chains they sacrificed their tyrants.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Bringing this brief analysis of the condition of slaves among the different peoples of antiquity into comparison with the account we have given of the treatment endured by Blacks in the colonies, it follows evidently that the latter are more unhappy and treated with less humanity.<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f10\" n=\"10\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/></tei-p>\n            \n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The climate of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Italy</tei-placeName> and that of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Greece</tei-placeName> are the finest and the healthiest. Can they be compared to that burning tropical sun under which Africans are condemned to labor? Cultivation in the colonies is far more difficult and more painful than in Europe.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Let us grant that the punishments of the ancients were as cruel, as terrible as those of the colonies; that the blood of slaves flowed under their blows, as it is spilled every day by planters; at least they had the hope that their torments would have an end: they could create a small fund and obtain their manumission, whereas the dreadful “never” is pronounced for Blacks.</tei-p>\n            \n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Among the Romans, the master’s simple declaration, made in temples or before the praetors, was sufficient to obtain freedom, and that freedom was not restricted like that of men of color in the colonies. Freedmen passed at once into the condition of citizens and shared in all the privileges of the city. The patent of freedom in <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName> is a certificate of infamy, a title that stains the origin of the freed: “savanna freedom” is an abuse, a sign of the perfidy and egoism of the colonists. They have made of it a mixed, vicious condition, incompatible with a well-established public order and with true liberal ideas. It is a new line of demarcation in favor of the colonial aristocracy—the most ridiculous and the most absurd of all—for there, as <tei-persName ref=\"#AD\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">M. de Laborde</tei-persName> has said, it has no motive other than difference of color.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The slaves of antiquity practiced the liberal arts and could engage in commerce; they were secretaries, clerks, architects, and authors. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Aleman</tei-persName>, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Epictetus</tei-persName>, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Aesop</tei-persName>, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Phaedrus</tei-persName>, and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Terence</tei-persName> did not see their genius stifled by the despotism of their masters. Woe to the slave who, in the colonies, could so much as read and write! Every kind of suspicion would hover over him without cease: one would fear correspondence, revelations on his part; death or a perpetual dungeon would be his only prospect.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Among the Athenians and among the Egyptians, magistrates received slaves’ complaints against the excesses and furies of their masters; temples, as we have said, were always open and offered them an inviolable asylum against brutality <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f11\" n=\"11\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/> and injustice. In our colonies, Blacks are men struck with civil death, inventoried like oxen, horses, and ploughing implements; <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">they are the master’s property</tei-emph>, an automaton driven by springs, an agent that receives the impulse and moves, pressed by a superior force: it is the lowest degree of abjection and debasement.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This leads us to an objection found on every tongue and which the colonists exploit with skill. Everyone has an interest, it is said, in preserving his property. Can one then conceive that, cheerfully, and to satisfy a whim, one would consent to sacrifice one’s fortune? Planters should not mistreat their slaves any more than their livestock; and if they seek to preserve an ox or a horse, why would you have them be indifferent to the loss of a slave, who costs them more and whom they replace with greater difficulty?</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This argument seems strong, and it is only specious. In the colonies, property does not have the stability it presents in France: hurricanes, wars, the diseases that ravage those lands—those scourges, constantly threatening—give everyone the desire to make of them only a place of passage. There, each seeks to liquidate in order to return to France: it takes stubborn labor to amass capital; one must grow rich quickly to shorten the time of exile. Negroes are precisely the passive instruments of this immoderate desire for riches; they are the machines used in this kind of exploitation. Moderate labor would delay too much; it is forced, and the expedients are rigor, a harsh and terrible discipline. In four years, the Negro pays what he cost, and since the remainder of his life is pure profit for the master, he is employed without respite and without consideration. He is a post-horse that must arrive on time, driven by the whip! What does it matter if he suffers, what does it matter if he dies at the end of the run, provided he arrives.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This comparison is crushing for you, gentlemen planters: your domestic animals receive from your hands—less miserly for them—food sufficient for their needs, while your Negroes are obliged to ask it furtively of the earth, in the moments of rest and during the most scorching heat of the day. Besides, are your oxen and your horses <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f12\" n=\"12\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>torn by whip blows like your Negroes? Do you make their blood spurt with the same ferocity? For them there is neither narrow, foul dungeon nor <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">four stakes</tei-emph>, nor chains, nor iron collars armed with spikes, nor all those refinements invented by your barbarity! You do not fear from them a revolt or a claim to rights: these animals are submissive because they must be; but for your slaves you would fear compromising your authority if indulgence were to take the place, for a moment, of your severe temper. You know that, in the depths of these human hearts, the idea of human dignity always germinates, that a noble hope is never extinguished there; a spark would produce a conflagration capable of consuming you. It is therefore necessary, by force of punishments, to surround them with a permanent terror, and they suffer, and they die under your blows.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I will not demean myself by answering those who have had little enough modesty to dare to compare the slaves of the colonies to our peasants. They extol to us the happiness of slaves; I would take them at their word, despite what I have seen, if, following the example of several figures in history, they wish to share the happiness of that condition. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Diocletian</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Cyrus the Younger</tei-persName> made themselves gardeners out of sympathy for the inhabitants of the countryside; <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Peter the Great</tei-persName> made himself a carpenter to study shipbuilding. Let the partisans of slavery follow these illustrious examples; let them go to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">America</tei-placeName>—if they are there, the thing will be easier—and let them share for some time the lot of those they claim so happy. After this trial, I shall defer to their assertions, if they persist. I therefore urge them to experience the leniency of the overseers, the voluptuousness of whip blows, the taste of a foul cod, nakedness, downpours, misery, the caprices of insolence, the furies of brutality—and then, if they have wives or daughters, the inexpressible charm of being made to satisfy at will the fancies of their tyrants.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">X.

Fortunate are those which have contained within their bosom only magistrates and assessors intelligently impartial, like those of <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName>, and which did not wish to add to the ridiculousness of the accusation the atrocity of the punishment!</tei-p>\n            <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In 1829, eleven free individuals of color, from the commune of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Sainte-Anne</tei-placeName>, were brought before the assize court of the district of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Pointe-à-Pitre</tei-placeName>. The charge bore the title of a conspiracy tending to bring massacre into the colony and to the destruction of the white class!</tei-p>\n            <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">What was the crime? The facts, as they were revealed by the debates—which, like all those of this kind, presented the hideous and disgusting spectacle of false testimony, arbitrary arrests, violations of domiciles, of private papers, ordered outside the case of flagrante delicto by the military authority—will teach us.</tei-p>\n            <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">A review of the militia dragoons, who at that time were the praetorian soldiers of the Creole aristocracy, among whom whites alone could be enrolled, had been ordered—not on the public square of the borough of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Sainte-Anne</tei-placeName>, which was to be the place of assembly, but on an estate where, as was customary, the dragoons had drunk like Swiss. The fumes of wine and tafia, combined, having heated their heads, free speech followed,<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f14\" n=\"14\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>\nand among the reckless remarks produced by drunkenness, several fanatics proposed, on their return, to fall upon the men of color, who for some time past had, they said, <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">become very insolent.</tei-emph> Others having joined in chorus with them, a dragoon whose head was cooler than that of his comrades, and who had received services from several persons of color, rode at full gallop to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Sainte-Anne</tei-placeName> and gave warning of these dispositions—dispositions which it was perhaps not in the thought of those who had conceived them to carry out. The men of color grew alarmed and resolved to defend themselves if they were attacked. They armed themselves, not to be aggressors, but so as to be able to oppose force to violence. A few imprudent words were uttered; one of them, recently emerged from slavery, in turn warned the whites of what was happening. The men of color were arrested, imprisoned, and accused of conspiracy...... Like the whites, they were guilty of panic terror. They were unanimously acquitted.</tei-p>\n            <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When, after the glorious days of July 1830, the hope of a better future entered all minds, the slaves too dreamed of freedom, or at least of some relief from their sufferings. Agents provocateurs, taking advantage of their natural disposition toward insurrection, persuaded them that the metropolitan government had granted them three days of rest per week, but that the local aristocracy had succeeded in neutralizing the effect of this concession by preventing the governor from promulgating the royal ordinance. It was easy to stir the slaves to a few expressions of discontent, to a few exclamations of independence. That was the basis of a charge of conspiracy. A Creole prosecutor-general was found who, in the indictment—a masterpiece of ignorance and ineptitude—made it a crime that a few slaves brought before the assize court had learned to read and write. It is true, as a national poet says with force, that: \n             \n             <tei-q data-origname=\"q\">One does not educate the one one wishes to keep enslaved.\n               The alphabet is deadly to absolute powers,\n               And man wants his rights as soon as he has read them.</tei-q> \n               \n               In this circumstance, as in the preceding one, the assize<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f15\" n=\"15\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/> court did not allow itself to be influenced by colonial prejudices, and there was acquittal as well.</tei-p>\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The third conspiracy—would one believe it?—was the work of a governor. It is true that, although of age, he acted without discernment, and that from then on public opinion had to absolve him, just as the accused were absolved by the jury’s verdict.</tei-p>\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Listen—and laugh, or rather shudder!</tei-p>\n               <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After fires that had taken place in <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName> in 1851 had provided the assize court of that colony with a matter it did not disdain, there were found in <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName> combustible materials near an old abandoned and isolated hut, to which fire had been set, though it had made no progress. On the other hand, hedges were burned, without it being possible to know whether malice or imprudence had presided over the event.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The governor of that colony then issued an order according to which freedom was promised to any slave, and a sum of three thousand francs to any free person, who would make known the authors of fires that might break out at various points of <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName>. This was to offer a bounty to denunciation: it answered the call.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Young Nelson is accused of having wished to set fire to a carpentry workshop in which he had worked as an apprentice. The Negro Jean-Baptiste saw him at the moment when, crouched in a corner of the shop, he was striking a flint to light wood shavings destined for the fire. The glow of the sparks lit up his face and allowed him to discern his features. He moved toward him in order to seize him; but at that very instant he was struck by a bullet that passed through the flesh of his thigh. He fell, and Nelson fled by opening one of the doors of the shop. The report of the weapon was heard by the neighbors: the Negro lay on the floorboards, gravely wounded; the preparations for the fire were found in the corner of the workshop from which the shot was said to have come. Jean-Baptiste named Nelson as his murderer, and he persisted in that declaration until his death, which followed his wound. The bullet extracted from the wound was wrapped in paper; that paper contained the first three letters of Nelson’s name. The accusation appeared plausible: it was not true. The debates show that Jean-Baptiste <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f16\" n=\"16\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>longed for freedom; that since the promulgation of the governor’s order he had announced that very soon he would no longer be a slave; that he had asked several individuals whether a bullet in the flesh would cause much pain; that the three letters written on the paper extracted from the wound, and which appeared there several times repeated, were those of the word n'<tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">était</tei-emph> (the ignorant instructor had not noticed the stroke of the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">t</tei-emph>, which, however, was clearly marked); that this handwriting was not by Nelson’s hand, Nelson who did not even know how to read. Finally, the latter established an alibi. He was unanimously acquitted by the court, which remained convinced that Jean-Baptiste had wounded himself in order to obtain his freedom by an infamous means, by devoting Nelson to the scaffold. The wretch paid the penalty of his misdeed. In vain had he wrapped in paper the very small bullet with which he loaded the pistol, because, in his coarse thinking, it was to cause less harm thus concealed. Providence willed that this bullet cut an artery. He died.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Ruined by debts and tormented by his creditors, a naval clerk, attached to the service of one of the state vessels, read the governor’s order. This order became for him an anchor of salvation: to create an incendiary conspiracy and then denounce its authors—four in number, himself included—receive, as the price of denunciation, 1,200 francs: such is his fixed idea. He pursues its execution with an awkward perseverance. He rents several apartments in different quarters of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Basse-Terre</tei-placeName>, deposits incendiary devices in these apartments, gives a dinner to a sailor from the ship on which he is embarked, to a non-commissioned artillery officer, and to a soldier of the 58th regiment, his compatriots. The meeting had been signaled in advance to the authorities; its aim had been indicated: to confer on the day on which fire would be set at various points of the city, already placed under the impression of terror by the burning of a few fragments of the roof of the clerk’s office of the court of first instance, situated opposite an infantry post, which from the first moment was able to master the progress of the flame. The imaginary accomplices of the informer—whose minds had been altered by the abuse of strong liquors with which they had been previously stuffed—remember nothing; but the splendor of the dinner, ordered with ostentation, compromised them. The combustible preparations found in the various lodgings of the naval clerk serve <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f17\" n=\"17\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/> as auxiliaries to his accusation, in which he does not hesitate to include himself as the repentant chief of the conspiracy, while concluding that the benefit of the remunerative order be applied in his favor.</tei-p>\n                    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After three days of solemn debates, the judges and assessors could not bring themselves to any conviction—not even that of the wretch caught in flagrante delicto of calumny and the most infamous turpitude.</tei-p>\n                    <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Such facts speak with eloquence; they carry with them their lesson. There at least, whatever the opinion of the judges may have been, they recoiled before the monstrosity of the accusation; they did not dare to give the world the hideous spectacle of those scandalous convictions in which the judges’ interest plainly dominates the entire case. The judges and assessors of <tei-placeName ref=\"#GP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Guadeloupe</tei-placeName> showed, in these three grave circumstances, some measure of judicial loyalty. In <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, it is not so; far from it. There they pride themselves on having fewer scruples: scaffolds are raised there with marvelous ease, and the oppressors walk with heads held high, always escorted by the executioner. Thus do we believe that, although the colonists of the first of these islands may be, perhaps to the same degree as their neighbors, imbued with the prejudices against which we have raised our standard, when the day comes when right and usurpation must settle their accounts in the colonies, there at least the voice of the blood of innumerable martyrs will not rise up to accuse, to curse, and to call for blood!</tei-p></tei-div>\n<tei-div data-origname=\"div\">\n                    <tei-head n=\"Du maintien de certains juges aux colonies.\" data-origname=\"head\" data-origatts=\"n\">ON THE RETENTION OF CERTAIN JUDGES IN THE COLONIES.</tei-head>\n\n      <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It is a very sad subject for reflection, this obstinate retention, as judges in the colonies, of certain men who have for a long time inscribed their names in letters of blood in the judicial annals of those unfortunate lands. One therefore asks by what strange and all-powerful influence these retrograde men are kept in office, despite the most just grievances and in spite of their removable status—men whose opposition to the spirit and the letter of the new legislation does not even, in most cases, take care to conceal itself.<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f18\" n=\"18\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n      One cannot understand why the naval offices, which cannot plead ignorance, have not long since done justice upon the prevaricating judges to whom we allude, and whom the majority of the colonial population, white and of color, rejects with contempt and points out as one of the most active causes of the divisions and hatreds by which the country is riven. From several quarters we have received, on this score, more than expressions of astonishment: we have received assertions, founded on very plausible reasonings, which tend to nothing less than to gravely compromise the honor of highly placed men, as exercising the strange influence that maintains—against all reason—judicial power in the hands of a few men notoriously and exclusively devoted to the interests of the oppressive caste over the African race to which we belong, thus delivering entirely into these men’s hands the destinies of numerous populations.</tei-p>\n\n        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These rumors, we say, spread and gain credit more each day among the public, which can evidently attribute to motives of little honor only that high protection under which our <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">masters and lords</tei-emph> invested with judicial power in the colonies, a quasi-sovereign power, one may say, take shelter; and by means of which, by confining themselves within certain legal formalities that escape cassation, they have people hanged and strangled until death follows—those whom they provoke as enemies. In such a state of affairs, it is natural to think that the rulers shrink from no sort of sacrifice, and that too is what we are assured takes place. Those among them who possess great fortune (and names have been cited) would, it is said, at certain times make a considerable outlay of funds, in order not to be dispossessed of that judicial power of which they are above all jealous—as we have said previously, for what reason.</tei-p>\n\n        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Moreover, the greater the incrimination that results from these rumors, the more those over whom they naturally hover ought to seek the means to destroy them. Those means are very simple. Let them cease granting aid and favor to the colonial oligarchy and to certain removable magistrates who do not enjoy the confidence of the country; let them renew, in accordance with the spirit of our present institutions, the courts and tribunals of the colonies; and then these rumors will fall. But until then, let them not be surprised to be in a state of permanent suspicion. Indeed it cannot be otherwise. It is impossible that, when atrocious men—named a thousand times for acts that have aroused public opinion against them—when men not only devoid of progressive capacity and a spirit of conciliation, but who have even become almost notorious for their cruelty, are maintained in functions where they do nothing but harm, and always harm, those who with a word could make that harm disappear should not be suspected of acting, in a matter so important, under the stigmatizing influence of corruption.<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f19\" n=\"19\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/></tei-p>\n\n        <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">These grave suspicions are most powerfully corroborated by a consideration of great weight. The judges of whom we wish to speak—colonists and slave owners—are thus maintained, we say, despite incredible acts of malfeasance; the Ministry of the Navy covers them with its approval and with a favor that does not falter. But let a European magistrate wish to fulfill his duty rigorously by enforcing the repressive law against the slave trade; let him protect slaves with the law in hand; let him point out acts of peculation, finally display some independence in the exercise of his functions; let him permit himself only to dine with men of color (an enormous crime!)—he is immediately dismissed, brutally sent back from the colony, and his complaint expires in those same offices which have only indulgence and protection for Creole magistrates. On the one hand, malfeasance and injustice may be exercised with impunity; one does not even have words of blame for it. On the other, independence is punished like an offense, and without further form of trial one strikes the man who has been guilty of it:\n         <tei-q data-origname=\"q\">Convicted only of the detested crime\n         Of having loved, served, sung freedom.</tei-q>\n         In the presence of such facts, moral conviction cannot be commanded. So much the worse for the men whom that conviction strikes! We could not, in the interest of a cause that for us dominates all considerations of detail, hesitate for a moment to deliver these facts to the meditation of our readers.<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f20\" n=\"20\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/></tei-p>\n</tei-div>\n<tei-div data-origname=\"div\">\n\n   <tei-head n=\"Triste resultat du procès de la grand'anse.\" data-origname=\"head\" data-origatts=\"n\">SAD OUTCOME OF THE TRIAL OF <tei-placeName ref=\"#GdA\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">GRAND'ANSE</tei-placeName>.</tei-head>\n   \n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The recent decision of the Court of Cassation rejecting the appeal of our unfortunate compatriots of <tei-placeName ref=\"#GdA\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Grand'Anse</tei-placeName>, and which is about to bring terror and sorrow into the families of these wretched people, is founded solely on the fact that all legal formalities were observed by the judges of <tei-placeName ref=\"#MQ\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Martinique</tei-placeName> in the proceedings that led to their horrifying judgment. The Court’s decision strikingly demonstrates all that is tragic in the exceptional regime to which the colonies are subjected. Thus, we have the Court of Cassation driven to sanction the monstrous iniquity of the so-called assize court of <tei-placeName ref=\"#StP\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Saint-Pierre</tei-placeName>, because judges, assessors, and witnesses did not violate, in a sufficiently established manner, the forms imposed by the ordinance of 24 September 1828! Form has prevailed over substance, of which the supreme court could not be called upon to take cognizance, and thus men’s blood will flow because, this time, the Martiniquan judges knew how to confine themselves within the circle of obligatory formalities!</tei-p>\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This constitutes the indictment of that supposed organization which, in a sense, vests with the right of life and death men who are not the peers, but the enemies, of most of those they judge. That is a ground for cassation that may fail before the supreme court, but it will not fail before the tribunal of reason. For our part, it is the supposed organization by virtue of which all this has been done that we attack. For it is not, indeed, a law worthy of respect for the populations of the colonies, this judicial organization that is not the expression of their will, that was made without them and against them by an ordinance of the Restoration. That too must be the constant object of our opposition. We want freedom and equality for the colonies, as the parties to whom the future belongs want them in Europe. We want them full and entire, correcting and containing one another, resulting from the practical implementation of equal rights, because from these principles alone will be born for us an era of justice and happiness. If all the oppressed of our race were truly imbued with this truth and united their efforts to bring that time forward; if, in the face of the misfortunes that so cruelly afflict some of our colonies, those concerned would reflect that these very misfortunes arise from their exclusion <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f21\" n=\"21\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>from rights (rights imprescriptible for them), and were to demand unceasingly, with intelligence, perseverance, and firmness, the exercise of those rights, the obstinacy of their oppressors would soon be overcome, and we would have fewer misfortunes to lament in the future! It is in just right and in reason that we must have faith; it is by them that we shall prevail. And if our brothers die (God forbid, for all hope is not lost of saving them), let us weep for them, and not lose heart! Let us take up again, with more energy and ardor than ever, the defense of a cause that has such martyrs. Let each have confidence in his strength and in his will, and do all that lies within him to triumph, through intelligence and philosophy, for want of other weapons, over the oppression of a race whose power is made solely by our lack of unity and our moral inertia.

It has also been considered that, since slavery is proscribed by no other civilized nation, it is necessary to bring to bear the moral influence of <tei-placeName ref=\"#GB\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Great Britain</tei-placeName> to effect everywhere its most immediate and most complete abolition possible. The profound conviction of our religious duties, which has enabled us to obtain so much success in our own country, must inspire in us the same zeal in seeking all legitimate means to attain the same end abroad. <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Slavery, wherever it exists, is the same moral deformity; it is the same crime before God</tei-emph>; and it must be regarded with execration and condemned with boldness by every man who professes the principles of Christianity.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Moreover, there is rising at this moment in the Northern States of the <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">Union</tei-orgName> a powerful and almost unforeseen interest in favor of the slaves.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We believe we ought to cite here a few facts little known to the public.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The number of slaves in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">America</tei-placeName> exceeds two million</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In some places (as for example in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">South Carolina</tei-placeName>) education is forbidden to them by law, and a free man of color has no right to set foot on the territory. The testimony of a slave has no value, except when it serves to convict another slave. Trial by jury is not admitted there, even in capital cases. Finally, obstacles so insurmountable have been placed in the way of emancipation that even if a slaveholder, good and conscientious, wishes to rid himself of his iniquitous property, he has the law against him; he dares not, he cannot emancipate <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f23\" n=\"23\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>his slave unless he banishes him from his home and his family; for, to emancipate him, he must first take him to another state and exile him forever. The condition of free people of color in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">America</tei-placeName>, whose number exceeds 300,000, is also truly pitiable. Their acquired privileges are of little importance and little regarded, their degradation is intolerable, and their progressive banishment from the states is generally regarded as a maxim of national policy. We are still obliged to add that the traffic in human beings continues within the country with all the most abject and most disgusting incidents. Husbands and wives, mothers and children are publicly offered for sale, bargained over and examined like cattle, and then separated from one another forever, with the same indifference as if it were a matter of the sheep or oxen in our markets.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It was easy to foresee that such a state of affairs could not fail to awaken in America the sympathy and indignation of the friends of humanity. But unfortunately people there are so accustomed to slavery, the national contempt for men of color has such deep roots, that to this day that indignation makes little progress, even in the Northern States, despite the most energetic efforts of worthy men. When they have tried to bring about a revolution in public opinion, they have encountered nowhere either encouragement or help.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">However, far from losing heart, they have recently established at <tei-placeName ref=\"#Phd\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Philadelphia</tei-placeName> a National Society for the abolition of slavery; unfortunately the number of members is too small in proportion to the immense extent of the country which must be the object of the Society’s labors, and the modesty of its pecuniary resources makes one fear great difficulties in pursuing this generous undertaking. This Society requests our assistance. Several of its members have been eyewitnesses to the miraculous successes that the blessing of the Almighty has permitted us to obtain in our country, and they have resolved to follow our example. Their aim is to spread their principles throughout all the States by the means of the press and preaching, to stir and direct the efforts of all men who profess the same principles, by creating associations affiliated with the central Society; they have decided, moreover, to adhere conscientiously to the principle that <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">slavery, being a crime before God, must be abolished as such</tei-emph>, the principle that has always served as the basis of our actions.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The committee could not remain indifferent to the appeal of this generous Society; and when the hope of joining with it and lending it help decided us to prolong the existence and action of our own, numerous letters, arriving from several parts of the country, enabled us to judge that our view of this great cause had found an echo throughout the country. In some places, the committee has even been surpassed; at <tei-placeName ref=\"#Lvp\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Liverpool</tei-placeName> and in <tei-placeName ref=\"#Ec\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Scotland</tei-placeName> especially, considerable sums have already been subscribed; and the need for a central committee to coordinate and set operations in motion was evident and indispensable. The committee assembled amid these circumstances and, after a considered examination of its future work, reorganized itself by adopting the name of <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\"><tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">British and Foreign Society for the Universal Abolition of Negro Slavery and the Slave Trade</tei-emph></tei-orgName>.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">This title clearly sets out our aim, and we hope for the help and assistance of all good men in our country. We regard it as the first of our duties to support the abolition of slavery in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">America</tei-placeName> by all the means that can make it triumph; we shall send distinguished preachers, and we shall propagate, by every possible means, the lively interest that is beneficial to so worthy a cause.</tei-p>\n\n   <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">Society</tei-orgName> desires to become the organ of the voice of our enslaved and suffering brothers over the whole surface of the world. It will seek to unveil and bring to light the secrets of prisons and the cries of distress of the Negro exposed to the tortures of the tropical sun or chained in the abysses of the mines of Peru. We firmly believe that, by constantly arousing the attention of the public, we shall assist the protective influence that Parliament must retain over the rigorous observance of our laws and treaties, whose salutary provisions, intended to prevent the slave trade, often remain without execution in ministerial offices. We also believe that the impulse given by <tei-placeName ref=\"#GB\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">Great Britain</tei-placeName> will induce other countries to follow the noble example we offer them.</tei-p>\n\n  <tei-div data-origname=\"div\">\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We feel all that is difficult, even presumptuous, in our hopes; but is it possible to forget that the e<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f24\" n=\"24\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>mancipation of our colonies was regarded a few years ago as a dream of enthusiastic visionaries, or at most as an imaginary and impracticable utopia. Yet God has blessed our labors, though we had no other guides than the principles of Christianity, and no other aid than a few subscriptions. Encouraged by popular opinion, we have realized this dream of imagination, and after a few years colonial slavery has disappeared, if not everywhere and completely, at least forever in certain lands.</tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Full of confidence in divine protection, and conscientiously relying on the same Christian principle, we shall seek no other means to obtain the far greater and nobler triumph to which we now aspire; and we declare that we are guided by the holy book of the Bible, in seeking to bring about THE COMPLETE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE WORLD, <tei-q data-origname=\"q\"><tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">“not by force, not by power, but by my spirit,” said the Lord of heaven</tei-emph>.</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">The president</tei-emph>, George STEPHEN. <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">The secretary</tei-emph>, John SCOBLE.</tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Persons who wish to assist <tei-orgName ref=\"#Soc\" data-origname=\"orgName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">the Society</tei-orgName> are requested to send their subscriptions to <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">M.

Presided over by <tei-persName ref=\"#Bstd\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">M. de Bastard</tei-persName>.</tei-emph></tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">APPEAL OF THE CONVICTED OF <tei-placeName ref=\"#GdA\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"ref\">GRAND'ANSE</tei-placeName> (MARTINIQUE.)</tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After several successive adjournments, the examination of this great case had been set for Saturday, 22 November. During these delays,<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f25\" n=\"25\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/> M. Prosecutor General Dupin had the documents transmitted to him. It was rumored that he was to speak in this trial, which perhaps has no example in the annals of the supreme court. At the sitting definitively announced, of which we are about to give our readers an account, the bench of the public prosecutor’s office was occupied by <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Parant</tei-persName>, advocate-general, the court sitting under the presidency of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. de Bastard</tei-persName>.</tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">One notes the absence of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Councillor Mérilhou</tei-persName>, whom a painful and very recent loss prevented from attending the hearing. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Councillor Isambert</tei-persName> is also one of the magistrates whom one seeks with anxiety within the court: his seat is empty. It is soon learned that this honorable magistrate is abstaining, and that the Keeper of the Seals and the Prosecutor General have sought his recusal, on the ground that, in a letter to the men of color of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, written in his capacity as deputy, M. Isambert had expressed in advance an opinion on one of the grounds of appeal, that of amnesty (1).</tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Many men of color are present at the bar, among whom two are particularly noticed, living examples of the furies of another era, now reproduced a decade later in the events of Grand'Anse. One also sees behind the rail <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Macaulay</tei-persName>, of the Anti-Slavery Society of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">London</tei-placeName>, and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">MM. John Scoble</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">James Copper</tei-persName>, members of the <tei-orgName data-origname=\"orgName\">British and Foreign Society for the Abolition of Slavery</tei-orgName>. On the rapporteur’s desk lies the enormous case file, bearing in giant letters these words: “Insurrection de la Grand' Anse”.</tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Councillor de Ricard</tei-persName> begins his report, the reading of which lasts about three hours. We shall not follow this magistrate through the general outline of the facts that he sketches in broad strokes, and the grounds of appeal that he analyzes with impartiality. The facts are today well known, after all the contradictory publications to which they have given rise; we can do no better than to refer, on this point, to the Memoir of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Me Gatine</tei-persName> that we\n    <tei-note data-origname=\"note\">(1) The publicity given to this letter is not, as M. Dupin claims, the fault of M. Isambert. M. Fabien, representative of the men of color of Martinique, to whom the letter was delivered, believed he ought to publish it in the interest of his constituents.</tei-note><tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f26\" n=\"26\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>announced in our last issue. As for the numerous grounds for cassation, the pleadings that we shall report succinctly and the judgment will make them sufficiently known. On the ground of amnesty, the rapporteur read several documents transmitted to the court by the Minister of the Navy, including in particular a letter from the former governor <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Dupotet</tei-persName>, denying the orders and full powers he had given to <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Captain Montigny</tei-persName>, sent to meet <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">the insurrection in order to settle this matter by all suitable means</tei-emph>; then another letter from <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Rear-Admiral Halgan</tei-persName>, the current governor, who was not in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Martinique</tei-placeName> at the time of the events of <tei-date data-origname=\"date\">December 1833</tei-date>, and who nonetheless certifies that the insurgents were in no way amnestied. The reading of these documents, after that of the passages from the committal decision and from the indictment itself, which positively acknowledge the fact of the amnesty, is received with a painful sensation.</tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After the report and a brief suspension of the hearing, the floor is given to counsel. Mr Gatine, charged with the defense by all the condemned, with the power to associate another defender with him if the needs of the case required it, shares with M Crémieux the burden of this matter. Here is a rapid analysis of the pleading, full of warmth and logic, by Me Gatine:</tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“Gentlemen,” he says as he begins, “the appeal of the condemned of Grand'Anse rests on fairly numerous grounds for cassation. In any other circumstance, we would have feared abusing the moments of the court and the reverent attention it deigns to grant us, especially when we come before it to defend men sentenced to death. But here, in this forever deplorable affair, our grounds, however numerous they may be, still remain fewer than the number of capital sentences alone. In the presence of all these scaffolds, by probing this long procedure, we may have been able to point out to you all the nullities that it seemed to present, and your benevolence, we are assured, will not fail us for the rapid development of the proposed grounds.”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“In following the series of operations of the assize court, we had first to address the drawing of the assessors. The first five grounds relate to this phase of the procedure.”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“We shall first make a general observation, under the im<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f27\" n=\"27\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>pression of which the grounds seem to us to require assessment.”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“You know it, gentlemen, the colonies do not enjoy the institution of the jury. There one merely adds to the magistrates composing the assize court <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">assessors</tei-emph> taken from a college or body of criminal judges existing within the jurisdiction of each assize court. I say criminal judges, for that is the title that suits them: they are at once judges of fact and appliers of the penalty; they have, with few differences of attribution, the same powers as the magistrates themselves.”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“That is the importance of their functions. It makes one grasp the equal importance attached to the operations of the drawing and the formation of the assessors’ list.”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“But that is not all. What the court must remark above all is the composition of the assessors’ college. <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">They are recruited exclusively among whites.</tei-emph> No man of color is included, although a great number meet the required conditions. That is, gentlemen, a fact of the highest gravity in the presence of class enmity, before these implacable hatreds that attach to men of color and which, it was said, recently for this very trial, crossed the ocean, pursuing their victims even into your hall (1)! Gentlemen, in their sufferings, men of color often cry out that they have no judges in the colonies. At the very least they do not have judgment <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">by their peers</tei-emph>, that common right of French citizens in criminal matters. Ask the white assessors whether the mulatto accused are their peers…. Oh! yes, gentlemen, the drawing of the assessors, the recusals, the formation of the list of four for judgment, these are important formalities!”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“What happened? We shall see.”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n  <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Here counsel discusses five grounds, relating among other things to the recusal of the sieur <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Duval-Dugué</tei-persName>, who was kept on the list despite the accused, who wished to have him struck out: <tei-q data-origname=\"q\">They were exer<tei-note data-origname=\"note\">(1) <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">RICHARD-Lucy</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Lepelletier-Duclary</tei-persName>, who have condemned so many unfortunates in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, came to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">France</tei-placeName> with the documents of the trial. They were received by the Keeper of the Seals and by <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Dupin</tei-persName>, Prosecutor General. After their visit, M. Dupin sought, before the Court of Cassation, the removal of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Isambert</tei-persName>. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Charles Dupin</tei-persName>, brother of the Prosecutor General, is the agent of the privileged colonists of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Martinique</tei-placeName> <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">on a wage</tei-emph> of 20,000 francs <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">per year</tei-emph>.</tei-note><tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f28\" n=\"28\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>cising <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">peremptory</tei-emph> challenges, said Me Gatine, that is to say, absolute, without examination or discussion, for the law recognizes no others. It is a right for which it asks no account of the accused, no more than it asks account of judges for their convictions. The accused also had to <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">confer</tei-emph> in order to exercise their challenges; otherwise they would have been illusory for the greater number. Were they not there <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">eighty-eight</tei-emph>! Can one say that each of them enjoyed the right of challenge if no concert was established among them in all the breadth and all the freedom that must belong to the defense!</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“Should one not be astonished as well by the incident that marked the last operation of the drawing? A single name remained in the urn after all the excuses successively admitted, for everyone recoiled before the role of judge in this horrifying trial. The name of the sole assessor remaining was drawn from the urn; it could hardly fail to come out. Was it chance that drew it? Drawing lots is the choice of chance among a number of individuals greater than those that must be chosen; one understands it for a certain number of assessors or jurors; one understands it for a <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">plurality</tei-emph>; one does not understand it for a <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">unity</tei-emph>. Will it be said that there was no recusal? But it was impossible, for it would have prevented the formation of the list and would necessarily have sent the case to other extraordinary assizes. In sum, and this will not be the least deplorable, eighty-eight accused who were there, plunged for six months into dungeons, were forced either to renounce the exercise of their right of recusal or, by exercising it, to prolong still further the sufferings of their captivity, the anguish of a hundred families; yet the right of recusal is the very right of the defense. Once it was impracticable, the trial itself had become impossible. One could not find judges; all the assessors successively designated by lot recoiled in terror; the accused, by their number, so to speak innumerable, were themselves an impossibility; everything, in the preliminaries of the trial, led to the impossible! It was perhaps a warning from on high; if only it had been heard!”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Coming to the hearings, counsel pauses on the testimony of the witness Dieudonné Valmont, one of the most important, as the assize court itself declared: <tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“This witness,” says Mr Gatine,<tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f29\" n=\"29\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/> “was afflicted with mental alienation, according to a physician’s certificate that is probative; nevertheless his deposition was read. It is not one of the least strange circumstances of this dreadful trial that the introduction of such a document into the proceedings should be used to arrive at the discovery of truth. Do reason, morality, and public honor allow one to make use, in any matter whatsoever, of the deposition of a madman against accused persons? High-ranking magistrates, assessors taken from among the elite of citizens, criminal judges in short, having to decide the life or death of eighty-eight accused, will they seek their convictions in the narratives of a diseased mind! That is what is seen only in the colonies, there where abuse reigns, where the law is nothing.”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">The court must also examine whether the publicity of the hearings was sufficiently established. This guarantee had here an importance higher still than usual. This unheard-of trial, this great drama with its bloody denouement, which for an entire month unfolded in its monstrous proportions, ought at least to have taken place in the full light of day. If, in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, justice, besides its thousand wounds, were also <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">occult</tei-emph>, there would no longer be any restraint on abuses. Publicity is still a guarantee for those who no longer have any other.”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Mr Gatine then points out grave irregularities in the most important part of the trial, the framing of the questions of fact and their resolution.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The defenders had asked that the question be put whether many of the accused had not been dragged into the bands <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">under constraint</tei-emph>; for, in such a case, the leaders command, the multitude follows them, blind and intelligent. It is a case of excuse provided by law. The assize court of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Saint-Pierre</tei-placeName> could not dispense with putting the requested question. There lay the salvation of the accused: <tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“In a solemn circumstance,” says counsel, “on an application by the Prosecutor General, in the interest of the law, you judged by decision of <tei-date data-origname=\"date\">10 January 1834</tei-date> that the law was not violated by the putting of <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">a question of constraint</tei-emph>. I seize upon that decision dictated by reason and by humanity; I conclude from it that the question lies within the rights of the accused, within the rights of the defense, since the law does not forbid it. Here again, the right of the defense was ignored!”</tei-q></tei-p><tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f30\" n=\"30\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Finally, no penalty could be pronounced on the state of facts as they resulted from the answers given to the questions put. Counsel recalls the questions and the answers; he sets them alongside the provisions of the law; he concludes from them that neither the plot nor the attack imputed to the accused is duly established in all its constituent circumstances. He also notes, after a convincing discussion on this point, <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">that the aim and the character of the bands</tei-emph> were not determined. In support of his observation he cites several judgments rendered in the affairs of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Vendée</tei-placeName> and in that of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">rue des Prouvaires</tei-placeName> in <tei-date data-origname=\"date\">1832</tei-date>.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">“The consequences are palpable,” adds Me Gatine. “The attack committed in bands, the posts or commands in those bands, all facts stripped of the circumstances that criminalize them, are no longer reached by the penal law. Those who underwent the death penalty for those commands or posts could not be struck by it. Those who, for having merely been part of the bands, underwent perpetual expulsion from the colony could not be torn from their families, for article 100 of the colonial penal code, that legislative monstrosity, however discretionary it may be, can evidently be applied only insofar as it concerns <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">criminal</tei-emph> bands.”</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Mr Gatine concludes in roughly these terms:</tei-p>\n\n<tei-q data-origname=\"q\"><tei-p data-origname=\"p\">“There would remain to develop one ground that would dominate all the others, that of amnesty. But to assess that ground, one would have to enter into the examination of the facts, so that the court might see how amnesty was proclaimed as the only possible issue to a military event; how the governor himself, before his immense responsibility, had to have recourse to that amnesty; whether it is true that the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">insurrection of Grand' Anse</tei-emph> was only an explosion of colonial passions; whether it is true, finally, that blind and implacable enmities did all the evil in this affair.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">You would have to, gentlemen, count all these scaffolds, measure with sorrow this unlimited extension given to political accusations; for this is a work of politics, and of the worst, the most intolerant, the most murderous, the politics of the colonists!</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">After this long and laborious discussion, courage would fail us to place again before the eyes of the court so many desolations, <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f31\" n=\"31\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/> so many tears, so much blood already shed by armed force before the action of justice had begun!”</tei-p></tei-q>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Amnesty was the only remedy for all these ills. It was proclaimed by a military chief invested with the powers of the governor, as the indictment itself has acknowledged; and in the presence of that formal admission by the accusers, we scarcely understand that, with the delegations of the current governor, who was not in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Martinique</tei-placeName> at the time of the so-called insurrection, one should come to quibble over amnesty for ninety-three condemned! It is in contempt of that amnesty, in contempt of national honor, that so many men would go to perish miserably in exile or in the penal colonies, that so many families would be decimated, heaped pell-mell in this dreadful hecatomb!</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Gentlemen, this ground of amnesty deserves no less than the others the solicitude of the court. But, for our part, we shall not prolong any longer these long observations to which a colleague must still add. What we ask, we can now summarize and say in two words: it is an act of that benevolent vigilance that you do not cease to exercise over your overseas litigants, it is the revision of this trial, the most deplorable that has for a long time desolated the colonies; it is a new examination, new judges. One may look twice when fifteen heads are at stake!</tei-p>\n\n<tei-q data-origname=\"q\"><tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr Crémieux</tei-persName> then takes the floor: Gentlemen, I take the floor after the pleading you have just heard; it is not that I feel the need to add new arguments to those that have just been set out, but it is to fulfill a duty of conscience and humanity, so that my voice may not be lacking in this hall for these unfortunate men who, from the depths of their dungeons, asked for it as a favor, they who could demand it as a right. Oh! what a dreadful procedure, gentlemen, what a despairing condemnation! What then? The law will offer no means to annihilate forever this frightful decision! What justice, that of the colonies! Not that I wish to inquire whether the condemned were guilty, a competent tribunal has pronounced; but, great God, no mercy, no pity! Fifteen heads promised to the scaffold, <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f32\" n=\"32\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>twenty-five unfortunates destined for the penal colony, thirty, forty, what do I know, expelled from the colony forever, and a fearful mass of death sentences in absentia! You remember, gentlemen, the consternation that came to freeze the metropolis at that fatal announcement! And yet, it was possible not to prosecute, not to judge, not to condemn! It was possible, and I go further: condemnation, judgment, and prosecution are struck with illegality. I shall not enter into the examination of the fifteen grounds that have been successively presented to you; but there are two that are, in my eyes, of palpable evidence. One dominates the case, it abolishes the accusation, it strikes it and ruins it at its base, it is <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">amnesty</tei-emph>. Amnesty, pledge of peace and reconciliation, support of thrones, glory of princes, amnesty, so sweet to decree, so favorably welcomed by all who bear a generous heart.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">You judged it recently, gentlemen, with those high lights that recommend your supreme jurisdiction: when amnesty has been promised by a chief having authority, and that, on the faith of that amnesty, rebels have surrendered, judicial proceedings are null. Well then! In the case, an amnesty was promised, it was accepted, it was violated! What I assert, I prove by the committal decision. Here are passages that decide the question:</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Captain Montigny was charged by the governor to appease the sedition, and <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">to employ, to that end, all the means that would seem to him the most suitable.</tei-emph></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Thus, all the governor’s powers were placed in Montigny’s hands. Would one tell us, by chance, that the suitable means were only means of repression and vengeance? Woe to whoever would say such words in <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">France</tei-placeName>! Repression after promises, after threats, after summonses, after all promises of humanity; otherwise repression is a crime. Thus <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Montigny</tei-persName> had the power to grant amnesty, he granted it, here is the proof, I read the committal decision:</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Montigny</tei-persName> approaches the insurgents with twenty armed men, he summons them to surrender, in the name of the governor, and at these first words a great number throw down their arms. Then <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Montigny</tei-persName> approaches alone at a gallop, <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">he declares, according to persons who were within hearing:</tei-emph> for his part he does not recall his <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f33\" n=\"33\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>expressions well, he declares, in the name of the governor, that if they surrender NOTHING WILL BE DONE TO THEM; immediately, one of the chiefs steps out of the ranks, and <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">all the insurgents lay down their arms!</tei-emph></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Nothing will be done to them</tei-emph>, and death, the galleys, and exposure await them! They are amnestied, and they are struck with fury! Amnestied, and what amnesty? Not that which goes to seek the inculpated in prison and sends him away, after the charge, without judgment; but the amnesty of battlefields, the one that stops the shedding of the most precious blood; the one that says: Lay down your arms, do not redden yourself with the blood of your brothers, and the veil of oblivion will cover all. This amnesty is the salvation of all, not only of those whom you pardon, but of those who came to fight them; for, in combat, death reaps on both sides. And you violate this capitulation between brothers!</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Gentlemen, you will not endure it, you will quash a judgment that tramples underfoot what is most sacred in the world, the law of pardon. You will proclaim the rights of amnesty; and we who plead for Frenchmen from a distant colony will profit from this solemn sitting to say again: Amnesty! amnesty! let dungeons and prisons open before it, let citizens forget and forgive, and let a fraternal hand come to clasp the hand of the amnestied! (General movement in the audience.)</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Gentlemen, there is a second ground that likewise entails the quashing of this procedure, namely the violation of article 64 of the penal code, combined with article 359 of the code of criminal instruction. After recalling some of the arguments given by <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr Gatine</tei-persName>, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr Crémieux</tei-persName> adds: What did the accused say? We ask that a question be put in this form: Were the accused constrained to the crime by a force they could not resist? That question resolved in their favor, there was no longer any crime, and they refuse to put it! The assessors will know that there is no crime if there was force, and they will not declare guilt. Gentlemen, the assessors are the jurors of the colonies, and jurors have no questions of law to resolve, but facts to judge. And in what circumstance do you refuse to put this question? In a case where it concerns an insurrection, a civil war. And who does not know that in such a case the mass <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f34\" n=\"34\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/> follows and fights without understanding? Its will is the will of a few chiefs. Alas! almost always the chiefs escape through betrayal, and the thunderbolt strikes the people obeying the voice of the true guilty!</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">I stop, gentlemen, I did not mean to plead, but to call your high wisdom to these two points that carry the case. Let the scaffolds and the chains fall, let the judgments of exile and expulsion perish! Oh! I know well that fifteen heads will not fall; the king, I know well, will not suffer this <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">judicial butchery</tei-emph>; but nonetheless it is to death that the judgment destines them! The voice that implored me is <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">vox morituri</tei-emph>. Sacred is the prayer of a condemned man, especially of a political condemned; I have answered it as far as it depended on me; the salvation of all these unfortunates is in your hands, they will be saved!”</tei-p></tei-q>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Parant</tei-persName>, advocate-general, contests successively all the grounds of the appeal. As regards amnesty, he seeks to demonstrate that, under the colonial ordinances, the governor did not have the right to grant it.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">It is six o’clock in the evening; the court postpones the delivery of its judgment to <tei-date data-origname=\"date\">Monday 24</tei-date>. All day Sunday is spent deliberating. At the opening of the Monday sitting, the court again postpones its judgment to <tei-date data-origname=\"date\">Thursday 27</tei-date>. On that day, finally, the court sitting, Mr. President reads a long judgment rejecting the appeal.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">A painful impression follows this unexpected result. All those who had followed the court’s sittings with anxiety withdraw in a bleak silence.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">One wonders what the governor of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Martinique</tei-placeName> will do with his fifteen heads.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">An application for pardon was immediately filed by <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr Gatine</tei-persName>.

It is therefore good and useful to know what to think of this singular personage, who meddles in everything without suspecting anything.</tei-p>\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Here is the opinion of the capital’s newspapers on the appointment of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Charles Dupin</tei-persName> to the Ministry of the Navy and the Colonies:</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">LE COURRIER FRANÇAIS.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Mr. Charles Dupin</tei-persName>, who, by having himself designated under the title of <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">savant</tei-emph>, has almost succeeded in making the title of savant ridiculous, who has made proverbial the boredom inspired by his tribune speeches, whose disinterestedness is attested by the accumulation of twelve or fifteen posts, whose borrowed learning, diluted in large volumes, has pushed back the limits of charlatanism, <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">M. Charles Dupin</tei-emph> was, of all the men who could be chosen, the most antipathic to the naval corps, the one whose elevation was bound to cause the most discontent. What was hoped for in appointing him? Certainly, it was not thought to strengthen the cabinet with a man of the tribune; it was not thought to endow the navy with a specialist. Perhaps it was wished to reward the author of the motion that brought about the resignation and retirement of Lafayette; in that respect, he has well merited the Palais-Royal, and he may find that the reward was long in coming. No doubt too, one counts on attaching the naturally precarious and variable support of his brother; but even if that support were irrevocably acquired to the new cabinet, it would not compensate for what the presence of M. Charles Dupin brings with it: disfavor, unpopularity, <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f36\" n=\"36\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>and, it must be said, ridicule. It is said that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. de Rigny</tei-persName>, accustomed to being called the victor of Navarino, finds it somewhat hard to fall under the orders of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Charles Dupin</tei-persName>. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Louis-Philippe</tei-persName> indeed subjects the humility of his former minister to a rude test.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The influence of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Dupin</tei-persName> the elder will have contributed to having the combination adopted in which his brother found a place. For anyone who would judge the President of the Chamber by his parliamentary importance, his conduct, once again, would remain without explanation; as for us, it causes us no surprise. If <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Dupin</tei-persName> truly had political views and an ambition somewhat lofty, he would have avoided delivering the party of which he believes himself the leader to the public’s disdain and to the laughter of his adversaries. Instead of imposing the inflated nullity of his brother on colleagues who together brought neither too great a personal authority nor too great a sum of talents, he would have boldly undertaken it himself, and would have made himself the orator of that ministry which is now at the knees of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Sauzet</tei-persName>. One may feel indulgence toward oneself, but one cannot prevent a ministry that has added <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Charles Dupin</tei-persName> to itself from being devoted to ridicule.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">LE BON SENS.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The President of the Chamber of Deputies put his brother at the navy as a matter of family convenience. In this affair, there is no one to pity but the sailors, who will have to endure the pompous insufficiency of the successor of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Jacob</tei-persName>.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Charles Dupin</tei-persName> no doubt has a tireless organ and will give very verbose orders to admirals and to all naval officers; but the talent he has for making even the most resigned listeners flee the Chamber is a privilege that is not very parliamentary.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">There are people who know how to profit from their position, however difficult and humiliating it may be. We have said that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Charles Dupin</tei-persName> had resigned none of his employments, whose number is almost incalculable; that he had even kept the title of delegate of the colonists to the Minister of the Navy: he did better than that, he tried, immediately after giving his forced resignation, to have himself granted one of the richest sinecures, that of director of naval matériel. Having presented the ordinance of appointment to the king, the latter observed <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f37\" n=\"37\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>to him that he would be obliged to countersign the ordinance himself; whereupon the accumulator was forced to renounce the 20,000 francs of salary he had coveted.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">LE MESSAGER.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Seriously considered in its whole as in its individualities, does the new cabinet represent anything other than the court, which seems to have sought, outside all the required conditions, flexible persons for its immutable thought? Can one imagine an officer of maritime engineering, constructor of a single vessel which took on water on all sides at its first contact with the sea, commanding our fleets and directing our colonies?…..</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">LE NATIONAL.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Since we are in the time of devotions and sacrifices, we would like to know whether provision will be made for the replacement of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. le duc de Trévise</tei-persName> as Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honor. We advise <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Mortier</tei-persName> to imitate the foresight of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Charles Dupin</tei-persName>. This skilled calculator, delegate, as is known, of the colonists of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Martinique</tei-placeName> to the Ministry of the Navy, had judged it appropriate to remain delegate to his own person, with emoluments of 20,000 francs per year.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The talents and the salaries accumulated by <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Charles Dupin</tei-persName> have more than once been displayed before the electoral colleges and the committees of the Chamber. But this time, it must be admitted, M. Charles Dupin outdid himself.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">REVUE DES DEUX MONDES.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">France</tei-placeName> cannot always be tossed between <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">MM. Thiers</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Guizot</tei-persName>, or between <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">MM. Thiers</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Dupin</tei-persName>. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Dupin</tei-persName> already sees how poorly the idea succeeded that he had of sending his brother <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Raton</tei-persName> to pull for him the chestnuts of ministerial fire. Thus, if <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Dupin</tei-persName> manages to form, before the session, in his uncertain head, a sort of political system, if he arrives at forming a just idea of the amnesty he wants, if he succeeds in reconciling his hatred for his friends on the left with his aversion for his friends of the castle, in making agree his taste for popularity and his contempt for the press and for opinion, if he comes to unite all these <tei-pb facs=\"v1n6f38\" n=\"38\" data-origname=\"pb\" data-origatts=\"n facs\" data-empty=\"\"/>things, quite reconcilable as one sees, we shall soon have a third-party ministry, a ministry <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Dupin</tei-persName>, a unique ministry.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Following the resignation of the “three-day” ministers, the cabinet has been reconstituted as follows:</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">MM. Marshal Mortier</tei-persName>, Minister of War, President of the Council.\n<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Thiers</tei-persName>, Minister of the Interior.\n<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Admiral de Rigny</tei-persName>, Minister of Foreign Affairs;\n<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Humann</tei-persName>, Minister of Finance; \n<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Guizot</tei-persName>, Minister of Public Instruction;\n<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Duchâtel</tei-persName>, Minister of Commerce;\n<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Persil</tei-persName>, Minister of Justice;\n<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Admiral Duperré</tei-persName>, Minister of the Navy and the Colonies.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">-The ministry of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Lord Melbourne</tei-persName> has given way to the Tory-Wellington ministry. The <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Duke of Wellington</tei-persName> is First Lord of the Treasury, and, as principal Secretary of State, holds the seals of the departments of the interior, foreign affairs, and the colonies. <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Sir Robert Peel</tei-persName> occupies the functions of Chancellor of the Exchequer.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The following appointments have just taken place in the colonial judiciary and administration:</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M.

Pedemonte, <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Belost</tei-persName> and <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Bellaud-Descommunes</tei-persName> have been appointed privy councillors, alternates of the same colony.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"> -We read in the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Journal de la Marine</tei-emph>:</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The appointment of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Rivoil</tei-persName>, former solicitor, to the post of auditing councillor at <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Guirne</tei-placeName> has been the object of lively protests. The laws governing the colonies required that <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Rivoil</tei-persName> be a licentiate in law to fulfill the functions entrusted to him. It is said that at the Ministry of the Navy they are very dissatisfied at having been deceived on this point, and that they are resolved to reverse this appointment.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">-<tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Famiral Halgan</tei-persName>, Governor of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Martinique</tei-placeName>, who was not in the colony at the time of the Grand'Anse affair, was consulted by the Minister of the Navy on the question of whether there had been, on the part of the colonial authority, a promise of amnesty made to the men of color condemned in this affair. The admiral’s answer was negative; and the Ministry of the Navy hastened to add to the case file the dispatch of <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">M. Halgan</tei-persName>. The Court of Cassation did not admit the ground pleaded for the condemned, drawn from this promise of amnesty; the appeal of these victims was rejected!</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">-Another dispatch from Admiral <tei-persName data-origname=\"persName\">Halgan</tei-persName> to the Minister of the Navy pointed out several acts of cruelty by a colonist, who would have caused several of his slaves to die in torments and horrible tortures, says the admiral.</tei-p>\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">We learn that this colonist, who had fled during the first proceedings brought against him, surrendered, was tried by his brothers and friends, and acquitted, as was to be expected, unanimously by seven votes.</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">-We read in the second issue of the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Abolitionist</tei-emph>:</tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">In the correspondence of the English commissioners with the government, one gathers the sad proof that the infamous commerce of the slave trade is still carried on with activity and that the means employed by the government to prevent it are wholly insufficient. The number of slavers captured by the English on the west coast of <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Africa</tei-placeName>, and brought to <tei-placeName data-origname=\"placeName\">Sierra Leone</tei-placeName> to be sold, amounts to five, namely: four Spanish and one Portuguese. They had on board at the time of their capture 1,884 Negroes; 185 died in the interval before the sale of the vessels. There thus remained to be restored to freedom 1,701 Africans.</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-q data-origname=\"q\">We are firmly persuaded, say the commissioners, that the trade continues under the Spanish flag with as much perseverance as in the past. We are distressed, however, to have to announce that this infamous traffic soils the French flag.</tei-q></tei-p>\n\n<tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The latest news we have from the foreign colonies is of <tei-date data-origname=\"date\">12 November</tei-date>.

Les incidents entre les deux groupes qui se multiplient mêlent conflits personnels et solidarités de groupes. À la fin de l’année 1833, dans la soirée du 3 novembre, Romagé, rentrant du spectacle, aurait apostrophé un homme de couleur. L’altercation qui s’en suivit aurait entraîné un rassemblement considérable de libres de couleur. Dans les jours qui suivent, les conflits se poursuivent et donnent lieu à plusieurs arrestations, dont Romagé. Les autorités, en l’occurrence le Conseil Privé, de la Guadeloupe, décident d’exclure du canton de Pointe-à-Pitre ceux qui avaient été à l’origine de ces altercations.

He began practicing law in 1821, earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1822, became a lawyer and proprietor in 1825, was admitted to the royal court of Martinique and the court of 1era authority of Saint-Pierre in 1827, and was, between 1843 and 1844, a  colonial advisor and member of the municipal council of Saint-Pierre. As a defender of slavery, Ciceron was a political enemy of Cyrille Bissette through the 1830s; in October 1834, the two dueled in the Bois de Vincennes. Their political enmity is perceptible in several articles by Ciceron published in Journal du Havre in 1831, widely repeated in his “Petition to the King, to the nation and to the chambers” (dated January 1, 1832). Bissette responded to him in a letter dated May 15, 1833. In 1844, Cicero, present in Paris, acted as rapporteur for the “Observations of a special commission of the Colonial Council of Martinique on the bill presented on May 14 to the Chamber of Peers.”. These observations, signed by Le Pelletier-Duclary, president of the Colonial Council, concerned a bill for the abolition of slavery in the French colonies, refuting it point by point. Bissette's apparent good will towards former enslavers after the abolition of May 1848, and his association with the colonist Pécoul around legislative elections of 1849, brought him closer to Ciceron, whom he visited upon his return to Martinique on March 20, 1849.</tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Fils du notaire blanc créole guadeloupéen, Ambroise Cicéron et de Marie Victoire Artaud, Louis Marie Ambroise Dieudonné Cicéron est né à Saint-Pierre le 25 septembre 1797 et meurt le 11 avril 1870 en la même ville. Il est qualifié de praticien en 1821, étudiant en droit bachelier ès lettres (1822), avocat et propriétaire (1825), avocat avoué près la cour royale de la Martinique et le tribunal de 1ère instance de Saint-Pierre (1827), conseiller colonial, membre du conseil municipal de Saint-Pierre et propriétaire en cette ville (1843-1844). Partisan du maintien du système esclavagiste, Louis Cicéron est opposé à Cyrille Bissette durant les années 1830-1840. Il se bat d’ailleurs en duel en octobre 1834 avec Bissette au bois de Vincennes. Leur inimitié politique est perceptible dans plusieurs articles de Cicéron publiés au journal du Havre en 1831, repris largement dans sa “Pétition au Roi, à la nation et aux chambres” (datée du 1er janvier 1832). Bissette lui répond dans une lettre du 15 mai 1833 ensuite. En 1844, Cicéron, présent à Paris, se fait le rapporteur des “Observations d’une commission spéciale du Conseil colonial de la Martinique sur le projet de loi présenté le 14 mai dernier à la Chambre des Pairs. Paris : Impr. de Bruneau, 1844”. Ces “observations, signées de Le Pelletier-Duclary, président du Conseil colonial, portaient sur le projet de loi du 14 mai 1844, visant à l’abolition de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises, et le réfutant article après article...”. Le retournement de veste de Bissette vis-à-vis des colons esclavagistes après l’abolition de l’esclavage en mai 1848, son association avec le colon Pécoul en vue des élections législatives de 1849, le fit se rapprocher de Cicéron qu’il visita dès son arrivée en Martinique le 20 mars 1849.</tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n        </tei-person>\n        <tei-person xml:id=\"LePell\" id=\"LePell\" data-origname=\"person\" data-origatts=\"xml:id\">\n            <tei-persName xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Jean-Baptiste François Le Pelletier-Duclary</tei-persName>\n            <tei-persName xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Jean-Baptiste François Le Pelletier-Duclary</tei-persName>\n            <tei-birth data-origname=\"birth\">1791 or 1793</tei-birth>\n            <tei-death data-origname=\"death\">1865</tei-death>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lawyer at the court of Paris, assessor to the Superior Council of Martinique (took offic 1819), councilor to the Royal Court of Martinique (May 9, 1821, confirmed October 5 1828), of which he became president in January 1835, knight of the Legion of Honor (January 16, 1836), president of the Colonial Council of Martinique from 1834 to 1838 and from 1839 to 1847. He married Marie Elisabeth Nelly Cornette de Saint-Cyr, a white Creole woman on June 11, 1821 in Case Pilote. Like many white settlers, he refused any reformation of the slave system, particularly in favor of equality for free people of color. He was one of the members of the Assize Court of Saint-Pierre chaired by de Perinelle who judged the 173 individuals accused during the Grande Anse affair (Lorrain) of December 1833. He shared quite naturally the prejudices and principles inherent in the mentality and social group of the powerful white families of the colony who made up the colonial judiciary between the decades of 1820 and 1840. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">https://www.patrimoines-martinique.org/ark:/35569/w6lcx297j5p0/c1f43fd7-b3e2-4d32-b04f-d620bbbbf54e</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">https://man8rove.com/en/profile/eql4p4vv1-jean-baptiste-francois-le-pelletier-du-clary</tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Né le 26 décembre 1791 ou le 28 janvier 1793 à Case-Pilote en Martinique selon les sources consultées, décédé le 12 juillet 1865 à Case-Pilote, habitant propriétaire domicilié dans cette paroisse et quartier, avocat à la cour de Paris, assesseur au Conseil supérieur de la Martinique en fonctions en 1819, conseiller à la Cour royale de la Martinique (9 mai 1821, confirmé le 5 octobre 1828) dont il est président en janvier 1835, chevalier de la légion d’honneur (16 janvier 1836), président du Conseil colonial de la Martinique de 1834 à 1838 et de 1839 à 1847.

In his new role, he proposed set of gradualist laws in anticipation of the abolition of slavery in the French colonies. The 1845 Mackau laws, as they came to be known, improved conditions for the enslaved, promoted their access to religious instruction, and allowed for the practice of buying one’s freedom or the freedom of one’s kin (<tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">rachat</tei-emph>). Though many lauded the laws, Bissette attacked the laws swiftly and vehemently in his writings for their gradualist approach. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Dorigny, Marcel; Bruffaerts, Jean-Claude; Gaillard, Gusti-Klara; and Théodat, Jean-Marie, eds.,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Haïti-France.

Par la suite, il devient ministre de la Marine et des Colonies. À ce poste, il propose une série de lois réformistes en prévision de l’abolition de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises. Les lois Mackau de 1845, comme elles seront appelées, visent à améliorer les conditions de vie des personnes réduites en esclavage, à favoriser leur accès à l’instruction religieuse et à encadrer la possibilité de rachat, leur permettant ainsi d’acheter leur liberté ou celle de leurs proches.

Later, he was advisor to the royal court of Rouen in 1845. Married to the daughter of a coffee merchant and planter of Guadeloupean origin, Jean Joseph Albert Chaviteau, who settled in Cuba at the beginning of the 19th century, Nogues had strong ties to the planter community. Nogues represented the public prosecutor as attorney general during the Grande Anse affair in December 1833. The indictment prepared by Nogues in June 1834, recovered by the historian Armand Nicolas describes the events thusly: “It is an armed insurrection, prepared for a long time... by almost the entire colored population of a district of the colony, with whom conspirators from another district and even from several others had colluded to carry out the pillage, devastation and burning of the colony, to massacre all the whites there in order to seize their property.” The members of the Assize Court of Saint-Pierre, presided over by de Perinelle and composed of advisors Richard de Lucy, Le Pelletier, and Duclary, the same ones who condemned Bissette and his comrades, were all white Creoles. They sentenced 141 individuals of color to various punishments.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Nicolas, Armand,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Histoire de la Martinique, Des Arawaks à 1848</tei-emph> , Paris, L’Harmattan, 1996</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">\"Arsène Nogues,\"  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Man8rove.</tei-emph>  https://man8rove.com/fr/profile/a1r52vc3-arsene-nogues</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">\"CHAUVITEAU Jean Joseph Albert (1775-1823),\"  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Cimetière du Père-Lachaise</tei-emph> , 3 septembre 2023, https://www.appl-lachaise.net/chauviteau-jean-joseph-albert-1775-1823/</tei-bibl>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Né à Redon le 12 juin 1798, il occupe divers postes à Brest et à Nancy et est aussi procureur général en Guadeloupe puis en Martinique durant les années 1830. Puis, il est ensuite conseiller à la cour royale de Rouen en 1845. Marié à la fille d’un négociant et planteur de café d’origine guadeloupéenne, Jean Joseph Albert Chaviteau, qui se fixa à Cuba au début du XIXe siècle, il est donc lié fortement au milieu des colons. Arsène Nogues, est celui qui représente le ministère public en tant que procureur général lors de l’affaire de la Grande Anse (commune du Lorrain aujourd’hui) en décembre 1833. L’historien Armand Nicolas cite ainsi l’acte d’accusation en juin 1834 que Arsène Nogues dresse en notifiant que : “C’est une insurrection à main armée, préparée depuis longtemps... par la presque totalité de la population de couleur d’un quartier de la colonie, avec laquelle des conspirateurs d’un autre quartier et même de plusieurs autres s’étaient entendus pour porter le pillage, la dévastation et l’incendie de la colonie, pour y massacrer tous les Blancs afin de s’emparer de leurs biens”. Au nombre des membres de la Cour d’Assises de Saint-Pierre présidée par de Perinelle et composée de conseillers (Richard de Lucy, Le Pelletier Duclary), tous blancs créoles, les mêmes qui ont condamné Bissette et ses camarades, se trouve donc des hommes imbus de leurs pouvoirs discrétionnaires.

He was among the Chausseurs volontaires de Saint Domingue recruited to fight in the 1779 Siege of Savannah during the American Revolutionary War. During the Haitian Revolution, he served first as a lieutenant and then aide de camp for Louverture; he was promoted to colonel and then, as part of the expedition to take the eastern side of the island, was named brigadier general and commander of the district of Santo Domingo. After Louverture’s unlawful arrest and deportation in June 1802, Bélair raised the banner of revolt against the French expeditionary forces. Leclerc’s forces arrested his wife and mother, forcing Bélair out of hiding and leading ot his capture. He was executed on October 15, 1802. To the history of Charles Bélair must be added that of his wife, Sanite Bélair, a warrior in her own right who fought beside the insurgents. She was executed alongside her husband. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Dayan, Colin,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Haiti, History, and the Gods</tei-title>  .

In the immediate aftermath of the American Revolution, he opposed efforts to implement large-scale emancipation in his home state of Massachusetts, but, as primary author of the state’s constitution, which included a Declaration of Rights (written after Adams served as Envoy to France), Adams has long been associated with the state’s de facto abolition in 1780. It was only after the 1781 cases of Mum Bett and Quok Walker, enslaved people who cited the language of the constitution in suing for their freedom, that the document, which does not explicitly prohibit slavery, took on this accepted meaning. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">John Adams’s presidency is notably marked by the establishment of trade relations with Haiti, which was then in conflict with France.  These political positions, in combination with an 1801 letter in which he expresses “abhorrence” to the institution of slavery, claiming to have always employed free men at significant personal expense, have contributed to Adams’ enduring legacy as a committed abolitionist. Recently, historians have called attention to the ways in which his positions were more in line with contemporaries, noting both that, with regard to Haiti, agreement to continue commerce is hardly a statement of ideological sympathy, and that any actual belief in the principle of equality was never public or explicit.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#masha #michaël\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">John Adams est originaire du Nord des États-Unis et n’a jamais possédé d’esclaves, ce qui le distingue des premiers présidents américains. Bien qu’opposé à l’émancipation générale des esclaves dans son État natal du Massachusetts après la Révolution, il rédige pour le jeune État une constitution qui comprend une Déclaration des droits (il rentre alors d’une mission diplomatique en France) et œuvre de fait à la disparition progressive de l’esclavage dans le Massachusetts. Dans les années qui suivent l’adoption de la constitution en 1780, des personnes esclavisées telles que Mum Bett et Quok Walker n'hésitent pas à invoquer ce document pour poursuivre leur maître et réclamer leur liberté devant les tribunaux.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Le mandat de John Adams est notamment marqué par l’établissement de relations commerciales avec Haïti, alors en conflit avec la France. Ses prises de position politiques, ainsi qu’une lettre de 1801 dans laquelle il exprime sa « détestation » de l’esclavage et affirme avoir toujours employé des hommes libres, même lorsque le coût de leur travail était élevé, ont largement contribué à forger sa réputation d’abolitionniste engagé.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Cette image a toutefois été nuancée par l’historiographie récente, qui souligne la proximité d’Adams avec ses contemporains sur la question de l’esclavage. Le maintien des échanges avec Haïti, par exemple, ne traduit pas nécessairement une sympathie à l’égard de l’indépendance haïtienne, et Adams ne s’est jamais publiquement ni explicitement exprimé en faveur de l’égalité raciale.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n        </tei-person>\n        <tei-person xml:id=\"CB\" id=\"CB\" data-origname=\"person\" data-origatts=\"xml:id\">\n            <tei-persName xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Bissette, Cyrille Charles Auguste</tei-persName>\n            <tei-persName xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" data-origname=\"persName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Bissette, Cyrille Charles Auguste </tei-persName>\n            <tei-birth data-origname=\"birth\">1795</tei-birth>\n            <tei-death data-origname=\"death\">1858</tei-death>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#masha\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-figure data-origname=\"figure\">\n                    <tei-graphic url=\"portrait_Bissette_b827ac99f2.jpg\" data-origname=\"graphic\" data-origatts=\"url\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n                    <tei-figDesc data-origname=\"figDesc\">Portrait de Cyrille Bissette.

His parents, Charles Borromée Bissette and Elizabeth Mélanie Bellaine, were free people of color, and his mother was the illegitimate daughter of Joseph-Gaspard de Tascher de La Pagerie, making Bissette a nephew of Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In 1816, Bissette married Augustine Séverin, a free woman of color, with whom he had four children. During these early years in Fort-Royal, Bissette was not engaged in abolitionist activities, and was in fact himself a slaveowner, taking part, in 1822, in the suppression of a slave revolt in the village of Le Carbet. The following year, however, he was arrested, along with six other free men of color — Montlouis Thébia, Joseph Richer, Joseph Millet, Laborde, Louis Fabien, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">fils</tei-title> and Jean-Baptiste Volny — for possession and alleged distribution of a seditious pamphlet printed in Paris, entitled <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">De la situation des hommes de color libre aux Antilles françaises </tei-title>(which Bissette was alleged to have written).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Accused as architects of a plot to overthrow the segregationist organization of Martinican society, Bissette, Fabien, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">fils</tei-title> and Volny were branded and sentenced to the galleys for life. In 1827, with the help of attorney François Isambert, Bissette’s sentence was reduced to ten years’ banishment and the legal costs of the proceedings, which would remain a substantial burden. Garnering significant media coverage, the so-called <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Affaire Bissette </tei-title>catalyzed his political career.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In Paris, Bissette participated in the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Trois Glorieuses </tei-title>(“the three glorious days” of riots that led to the end of the reign of Charles X and the restored Bourbon dynasty), which earned him the decoration of the July Cross, frequented Republican circles such as the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Free Association for the Education of the People</tei-title>, joined a Masonic lodge, published several emancipatory petitions, and founded the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies, </tei-title>a press organ for the cause of the total and immediate abolition of slavery. This radical position would put him at odds with the majority of the French abolitionist community, including Victor Schoelcher, the eventual author of the 1848 decree. The distance between these two abolitionists develops into a rivalry after the publication of Schoelcher’s <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Des Colonies Françaises</tei-title>, which Bissette harshly criticizes for its stigmatizing, indeed, uninhibitedly racist, characterization of the free population of color of the Antilles. Overshadowed by the cult of Schoelcher in the assimilationist intellectual bourgeoisie, Bissette is deliberately written out of abolitionist history for his later reconciliationist platform and his strategic alliance with a white planter in the legislative elections of 1849.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bongie, Chris. “1835, ou ‘Le troisième cycle’: The Creole Afterlives of Cyrille-Charles Auguste Bissette, Louis de Maynard de Queilhe, and Victor Schoelcher.” In  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Islands and Exiles: The Creole Identities of Post/Colonial Literature</tei-title> .

He entered military service in 1785 in the Royale-Marine regiment and quickly rose through the ranks. Appointed second lieutenant in 1792 in the 21st Cavalry Regiment, he distinguished himself during the campaigns of the Revolution, the Consulate, and the Empire between 1793 and 1807, earning a promotion to divisional general on December 6, 1807. In 1815, he fought at Waterloo and continued his career under the Bourbon Restoration. On October 31, 1817, Louis XVIII appointed him civil and military governor of Martinique, a position he held until 1826 before requesting to return to France.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">His administration was marked by his firm support for maintaining the slave system, which earned him the favor of the island’s white plantation owners. In October 1822, during the slave uprising in Le Carbet, he ordered a violent crackdown led by white militias and free men of color, among whom was Cyrille Bissette. Although he initially showed some willingness to listen to the grievances of Fort-Royal’s free people of color, particularly those voiced by Bissette, Donzelot gradually distanced himself from this stance. Pressured by white landowners determined to protect their privileges and exclude free people of color from any claim to equality, he became convinced that they harbored rebellious intentions and sought to incite an uprising akin to that of Saint-Domingue.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The Bissette Affair (1823-1824) definitively aligned him with the interests of the slaveholding elite. Under his governance, more than two hundred individuals were deported without trial. In 1826, he was granted his request to return to France. He retired to Mamirolle before settling in Neuilly-sur-Marne, where he died on July 11, 1843.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Schloss, Rebecca Hartkopf.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Sweet Liberty: The Final Days of Slavery in Martinique</tei-title>  .

Il entre au service en 1785 dans le régiment Royale-Marine et gravit rapidement les échelons militaires. Nommé sous-lieutenant en 1792 au 21ᵉ régiment de cavalerie, il se distingue lors des campagnes de la Révolution, du Consulat et de l’Empire entre 1793 et 1807, ce qui lui vaut d’être promu général de division le 6 décembre 1807. En 1815, il se distingue à Waterloo, poursuivant ensuite sa carrière sous la Restauration. Le 31 octobre 1817, Louis XVIII le nomme gouverneur civil et militaire de la Martinique, un poste qu’il occupe jusqu’en 1826, avant de demander son rappel en Métropole.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Son administration est marquée par son soutien au maintien du système esclavagiste, ce qui lui vaut l’estime des colons blancs de l’île. En octobre 1822, lors de la révolte des esclaves du Carbet, il ordonne une répression brutale menée par les milices blanches et les libres de couleur, parmi lesquels figure Cyrille Bissette. Bien qu’ayant initialement prêté une oreille attentive aux doléances des libres de couleur de Fort-Royal, notamment sous l’impulsion de Bissette, Donzelot s’éloigne progressivement de cette position. Harcelé par les propriétaires blancs, soucieux de préserver leurs privilèges et d’exclure les libres de couleur de toute prétention à l’égalité, il se laisse convaincre que ces derniers nourrissent des velléités de révolte et qu’ils aspirent à un soulèvement comparable à celui de Saint-Domingue.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">L’affaire Bissette (1823-1824) scelle définitivement son alignement sur les intérêts des planteurs esclavagistes. Sous sa gouvernance, plus de deux cents personnes sont déportées sans procès. En 1826, son souhait de retourner en Métropole est exaucé. Il se retire à Mamirolle avant de s’établir à Neuilly-sur-Marne, où il meurt le 11 juillet 1843.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Schloss, Rebecca Hartkopf.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Sweet Liberty: The Final Days of Slavery in Martinique</tei-title>  .

In an early draft of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson blames George III for forcefully maintaining the slave trade in North America, though this condemnation is less a matter of moral outrage than fear of organized rebellion. Jefferson received a copy of <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">De la littérature des Nègres</tei-emph> (1808), a work excerpted in numerous issues of the Revue des Colonies, directly from Abbé Grégoire. His response actually criticizes the work, whose arguments for equal humanity depend on the intellectual accomplishments of Black people, for implying that rights should be bound to talent. For his own part, Jefferson was notably dismissive of the intellectual talents of Benjamin Banneker, the free-born Black polymath who wrote to him in 1791 demanding (unsuccessfully) that he act according to his professed principles and Phillis Wheatley, the enslaved poet whose work was widely circulated on both sides of the Atlantic.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Notes</tei-emph>, published in France (while Jefferson was serving as minister to the court of Louis XVI) as a response to questions posed to the Continental Congress by delegate François Barbé-Marbois, Jefferson argues that any large-scale emancipation project would destabilize the young state by plunging it into violent racial conflict. As an alternative, he takes up the nascent cause of colonization, a position roundly criticized by later American abolitionists, most notably David Walker in his <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Appeal</tei-emph> (1829). At this time, Jefferson was living with Sally Hemings, an enslaved woman of mixed race and his deceased wife’s half-sister. This sexual relationship, to which Hemings would have had no meaningful way of consenting, was believed to have lasted four decades, producing several children. Hemings experienced the conditions of legal freedom for the first time while in France and returned to Virginia only on the condition that Jefferson would emancipate their children upon their reaching adulthood.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Finkelman, Paul.  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Slavery and the Founders : Race and Liberty in the Age of Jefferson</tei-emph> .

Lourdement endetté, Jefferson émancipe très peu de personnes au cours de sa vie, et ce alors même qu’il exprime à de nombreuses reprises des positions critiques sur l’esclavage.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Jefferson évoque la question de l’esclavage dans plusieurs de ses écrits, en particulier <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">A Summary View of the Rights of British America</tei-emph> (1774) et <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Notes on the State of Virginia</tei-emph> (1785), son texte le plus connu. S’il ne défend pas l’institution esclavagiste, il insiste cependant sur les risques et les difficultés de son abolition éventuelle. Dans une première version de la Déclaration d’indépendance, Jefferson reproche à George III d’avoir maintenu la traite en Amérique du Nord, ce qui traduit moins une indignation morale que la crainte de voir les esclaves se soulever. Lorsque l’abbé Grégoire publie <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">De la littérature des nègres</tei-emph> en 1808, dont de nombreux extraits sont reproduits dans la Revue des Colonies, il fait parvenir un exemplaire à Jefferson. Dans sa réponse à Grégoire, Jefferson critique l’ouvrage, qui, en s’appuyant sur les accomplissements intellectuels des personnes noires pour défendre l’égalité humaine, suggère que les droits humains devraient être conditionnés au talent.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">En outre, Jefferson fait preuve de condescendance envers Benjamin Banneker, mathématicien noir né libre, qui lui adresse une lettre en 1791 l’exhortant (sans succès) à agir en cohérence avec ses principes égalitaires, ainsi qu’envers Phillis Wheatley, poétesse esclavisée dont les œuvres sont largement diffusées des deux côtés de l’Atlantique.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Dans <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Notes on the State of Virginia</tei-emph>, publié en réponse aux questions posées au Congrès continental par François Barbé-Marbois alors que Jefferson occupe le poste de ministre plénipotentiaire des États-Unis à la cour de Louis XVI, il soutient qu’un projet d’émancipation à grande échelle risquerait de déstabiliser la nation naissante en provoquant des conflits raciaux violents. Jefferson choisit plutôt d’adhérer à la cause dite de la colonisation – c’est-à-dire l’expatriation des plus ou moins contrainte des Africains-Américains libres –, un projet que les abolitionnistes américains critiqueront fermement par la suite, à l’instar de David Walker dans <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World</tei-emph> (1829).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">À la fin des années 1780, Jefferson vit en concubinage avec Sally Hemings, femme de couleur esclavisée et demi-sœur de sa défunte épouse. Cette relation, à laquelle Hemings ne pouvait consentir, aurait duré près de quarante ans et a généré une descendance. Hemings fait pour la première fois l’expérience de la liberté lorsqu’elle est en France et n’accepte de retourner en Virginie qu’à la condition que Jefferson s’engage à affranchir leurs enfants à leur majorité.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Finkelman, Paul.  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Slavery and the Founders : Race and Liberty in the Age of Jefferson</tei-emph> .

During the Revolution, Washington, conceding to the demands of war after initial reluctance, led an integrated Continental Army, including free and enslaved men of color. As President, however, Washington carefully avoided maintaining consistent residence in Philadelphia, the nation’s first capital, to avoid being subject to Pennsylvania’s gradual abolition act of 1780.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Washington was a third-generation enslaver, who, at the time of his death in 1799, held personal claim to 123 enslaved people, while his Virginia home and plantation, Mount Vernon, benefited from the labor of over 300 in total, the remainder being temporary laborers or enslaved people inherited from the estate of his wife’s first husband. In his will, published widely in U.S. papers, he stipulated emancipation for those in his personal estate upon Martha Washington’s death, suggesting a moral stance while notably deferring financial loss to his inheritors. Meanwhile, through the final years of his life, he continued a relentless pursuit of Ona Judge, a young enslaved woman who had fled Mount Vernon for New Hampshire. In seeking to recover her, he refused her willing return on the condition of being freed after his and Martha’s deaths, and only hesitated to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 for fear of drawing negative publicity to the case and galvanizing northern abolitionists.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Historians continue to debate Washington’s personal degree of comfort with or distaste for the institution of slavery, and whether he harbored any conviction to endorse gradual abolition.  François Furstenberg has drawn attention to his bound collection of antislavery tracts from American and European sources while noting that several of these works were never opened and his sentiments on the matter were restricted to private correspondence.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Dunbar, Erica Armstrong.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge</tei-title>  .  New York: 37 Ink/Atria, 2017.</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Rossignol, Marie-Jeanne and Michaël Roy, with Marlene L.

Dans sa quête de soutien français pour l’indépendance américaine, il ne lie pas explicitement cette cause à celle de l’émancipation. Pendant la Révolution, Washington, contraint par les impératifs de la guerre,dirige une armée non ségréguée, qui inclut des hommes de couleur libres et asservis. En tant que président, Washington s’est toutefois soigneusement abstenu de résider de manière prolongée à Philadelphie, première capitale du pays, afin d’éviter d’être soumis à la loi d’abolition graduelle de l’esclavage adoptée par la Pennsylvanie en 1780.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Issu d’une famille d’esclavagistes vieille de trois générations, Washington possède à sa mort, en 1799, quelque 123 personnes esclavisées. En tout, plus de 300 personnes travaillent dans sa plantation de Mount Vernon, en Virginie, parmi lesquelles des travailleurs temporaires et des esclaves hérités du premier mariage de sa femme, Martha. Dans son testament, largement diffusé dans la presse américaine, Washington prévoit que ses esclaves seront émancipés à la mort de son épouse, ce qui lui permet d’afficher une posture morale tout en reportant les pertes financières sur ses héritiers. Parallèlement, durant les dernières années de sa vie, il poursuit sans relâche Ona Judge, une jeune femme asservie qui s’est enfuie de Mount Vernon et a gagné le New Hampshire. Lorsque celle-ci propose de revenir à la condition que sa liberté lui soit accordée après la mort de George et Martha, Washington refuse ; de même, il hésite à se saisir de la loi sur les esclaves fugitifs de 1793, craignant que cela n’attire l’attention et ne galvanise les abolitionnistes du Nord.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Les historiens continuent de débattre de la position plus ou moins critique de Washington sur l’esclavage et de son degré d’adhésion au projet d’une abolition graduelle de l’institution. François Furstenberg s’est notamment intéressé à sa collection de livres, qui comprend plusieurs brochures abolitionnistes publiées en Europe et en Amérique du Nord. Il note cependant que certains de ces volumes n’ont jamais été ouverts, et que les réflexions de Washington sur la question restent cantonnées à sa correspondance privée.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Dunbar, Erica Armstrong.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\"><tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge</tei-emph></tei-title> .  New York: 37 Ink/Atria, 2017.</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Rossignol, Marie-Jeanne et Michaël Roy, avec Marlene L.

Dumas received early education in his native Villers-Cotterets from Abbé Grégoire, who ran a local school. By the 1830’s, Dumas was a successful dramatist and a leading figure in the Romantic movement, though he was not favored by contemporary critics. Over the course of the twentieth century, Dumas’ canonical status would be solidified, culminating with the transfer of his remains to the Pantheon in 2002.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Dumas’ Haitian ancestry, and accordingly, his race were regular subjects of caricature and malicious insinuation in his time, thus Dumas rarely explicitly identified himself as a person of color or took up questions of race and slavery in his writing.

Dumas received early education in his native Villers-Cotterets from Abbé Grégoire, who ran a local school. By the 1830’s, Dumas was a successful dramatist and a leading figure in the Romantic movement, though he was not favored by contemporary critics. Over the course of the twentieth century, Dumas’ canonical status would be solidified, culminating with the transfer of his remains to the Pantheon in 2002.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Dumas’ Haitian ancestry, and accordingly, his race were regular subjects of caricature and malicious insinuation in his time, thus Dumas rarely explicitly identified himself as a person of color or took up questions of race and slavery in his writing.

Among his primary directives was the abolition of all distinctions against free people of color, ensuring their legal assimilation with whites. On November 12, 1830, he signed a decree eliminating certain outdated local regulations that had perpetuated discrimination.

He became involved in a dispute between the white Creole Louis Lasserre and the free man of color, Faustin Rosemond, whose home was sold, by judicial decision, to Lasserre. Rosemond is said to have shot Lasserre's horse while the latter was on his property in August 1833. He was charged with attempted assassination for being present at the scene where Rosemond and his brother-in-law committed the act. The Assize Court of Saint-Pierre, meeting on December 21, 1833, was expeditious and condemned Césaire for “complicity in an attempted assassination on the person of Lasserre, with premeditation and ambush”. On the island, the announcement of the conviction had an immediate and powerful effect, catalyzing the uprising of the free men of color of Grande Anse (December 24) within a few days. In the Revue des Colonies, Bissette would become Césaire’s most vocal defender. On April 4, 1834, lawyer Gatine presented the “means of cassation”. The Court of Cassation ruled on the following September 13 and overturned Césaire's judgment. He was retried on February 16 and 17, 1835 and was acquitted. Bissette declared himself satisfied with the outcome. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Pâme, Stella.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Cyrille Bissette: un martyr de la liberté</tei-title> .

Il aurait tiré sur le cheval de Lasserre alors que celui-ci se rend sur sa propriété en août 1833. Inculpé de tentative d’assassinat sur la personne de Lasserre parce qu’il se trouve sur les lieux alors que Rosemond et son beau-frère sont les vrais responsables du guet-apens. La cour d’assises de Saint-Pierre, réunie le 21 décembre 1833, est expéditive et condamne Césaire pour “complicité dans une tentative d’assassinat sur la personne de Lasserre, avec préméditation et guet-apens”. Dans l’ile, l’annonce de la condamnation fait l’effet d’un coup de tonnerre et précède le soulèvement des hommes de couleur libres de la Grande Anse (le 24 décembre) de quelques jours. Bissette se fait un artisan défenseur de Césaire en Métropole dans la Revue des Colonies. Le 4 avril 1834, l’avocat Gatine présente les “moyens de cassation”. La cour de cassation se prononce le 13 septembre suivant et casse le jugement de Césaire. Il est rejugé les 16 et 17 février 1835 et cette fois il est acquitté. Bissette se déclare satisfait du dénouement. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Pâme, Stella.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Cyrille Bissette: un martyr de la liberté</tei-title> .

He then had the highest rank for a man of color within this colonial institution. The regiments people of color from Saint-Pierre refused to march on the Grande Anse in order to repress the “insurrection” led by other free people of color.

He was the eldest son of Louis Philippe Joseph, Duke of Orléans (known as Philippe Égalité), and Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre. A supporter of the French Revolution, he joined the National Guard and enlisted in the revolutionary army, participating in the battles of Valmy and Jemappes. Accused of treason, he was outlawed by the revolutionary government. During the Reign of Terror, in November 1793, his father, Philippe-Égalité, was arrested and guillotined.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">That same year, Louis-Philippe began a long exile, living in Switzerland and Germany in 1795, the United States in 1796, and finally settling in England in 1800. In 1809, he married Princess Marie-Amélie of Bourbon, daughter of the King of Naples, in Sicily. After several failed attempts to return to France, Louis XVIII authorized his return in 1814 and restored his father’s confiscated properties. However, he remained excluded from the royal court until 1817.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">More than a decade later, from July 27 to 29, 1830, the people of Paris rose up in what became known as the Three Glorious Days (<tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Trois Glorieuses</tei-emph>). Following Charles X’s flight, Louis-Philippe was propelled to power on July 30, 1830. Under the Restoration, Charles X had pursued policies that strongly favored property owners, including the ordinance of April 17, 1825, which imposed the Haitian indemnity to compensate former colonists, and the law of April 27, 1825, known as the Billion for the Emigrés, which indemnified émigrés who had lost property confiscated and sold during the Revolution. Seeking to navigate opposition from republicans, Bonapartists, legitimists, and socialists, Louis-Philippe adopted a liberal political approach.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">In the old colonies, which also underwent abrupt political change in 1830, the long cycle of segregation against free people of color came to an end with a series of local and metropolitan egalitarian measures. At the same time, despite growing calls from abolitionists, particularly the French Society for the Abolition of Slavery (SFAE), founded in 1834, the regime sought to preserve slavery—at least in the short term—implementing gradual reforms rather than outright abolition. The July Monarchy also pursued an aggressive colonial expansion policy, marked by the conquest of Algeria in 1830 and the acquisition of key strategic territories along major maritime routes, including Nosy Be, Mayotte, Tahiti, and the Marquesas Islands.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The February 22–25, 1848 uprising in Paris forced Louis-Philippe to abdicate and flee to Britain. Queen Victoria granted him residence at Claremont House in Surrey, where he died two years later, on August 26, 1850. In the colonies, the fall of the July Monarchy and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Second Republic in February 1848 accelerated the abolition of slavery. Within two months, the decree was issued, officially abolishing slavery on April 27, 1848.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Jennings, Lawrence, \"Abolitionnisme, jeu politique et réforme : France, 1814-1848\", in Pétré Grenouilleau Olivier (dir),  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Abolir l’esclavage.

Il est le fils aîné de Louis Philippe Joseph, duc de Bourgogne (dit Philippe Égalité) et d’Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre. Partisan de la Révolution française, il rejoint la Garde nationale et s’engage dans l’armée révolutionnaire. Il participe aux batailles de Valmy et de Jemmapes. Accusé de traitrise, il est proscrit du gouvernement révolutionnaire. Sous la Terreur, en novembre 1793, son père Philippe-Égalité est mis en accusation et guillotiné.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">La même année, Louis-Philippe débute un long exil international (Suisse, Allemagne en 1795, États-Unis en 1796 et enfin en Angleterre en 1800 où il s’installe). En 1809, il épouse en Sicile la princesse Marie-Amélie de Bourbon, fille du roi de Naples. Après plusieurs tentatives de retour, Louis XVIII l’autorise à rentrer en France en 1814 et lui rend les biens de son père. Il sera cependant maintenu à l’écart de la cour jusqu’en 1817.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Plus d’une décennie plus tard, les 27, 28 et 29 juillet 1830, le peuple parisien se soulève. Ce sont les trois glorieuses. Louis-Philippe est alors propulsé au pouvoir le 30 juillet 1830, dès la fuite de Charles X qui, sous la Restauration, mena une politique très favorable aux intérêts des propriétaires (ordonnance du 17 avril 1825 sur l’indemnité haïtienne destinée aux anciens colons de la colonie ; loi du « milliard des émigrés du 27 avril 1825 indemnisant les émigrés ayant perdu leurs biens vendus sous la Révolution). Afin de ménager ses nombreuses oppositions (républicains, bonapartistes, légitimistes et socialistes), Louis-Philippe choisit de mener une politique libérale.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Dans les « vieilles colonies » - elles aussi précipitées en 1830 dans ce brusque changement de régime politique - le cycle de ségrégations à l’encontre des libres de couleur s’achève avec une série de mesures égalitaires locales et métropolitaines. Dans le même temps, et malgré les nombreux appels des abolitionnistes, notamment ceux de la Société française pour l’abolition de l’esclavage (SFAE) fondée en 1834, le régime se place dans une logique de maintien de l’esclavage, du moins à court terme, et propose de lents aménagements, à défaut d’une abolition radicale. La Monarchie de Juillet mène par ailleurs une politique d’expansion coloniale marquée, dès 1830, par la conquête de l’Algérie, d’une part, et par l’acquisition, comme points de relâche ou d’appui sur les grandes routes maritimes, de nouveaux territoires (Nossibé, Mayotte, Tahiti, Marquises).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Le soulèvement du peuple de Paris entre le 22 et le 25 février 1848 conduit Louis-Philippe à abdiquer et à quitter le territoire pour la Grande-Bretagne. La reine Victoria met à sa disposition le château de Claremont (dans le Surrey) où il meurt deux ans plus tard, le 26 août 1850. Pour les colonies, la chute de la Monarchie de Juillet et l’instauration du Gouvernement provisoire de la IIe République par la Révolution de février 1848 à Paris précipitent la proclamation de l’abolition de l’esclavage. En deux mois, le décret est publié : elle est officielle le 27 avril 1848.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Jennings, Lawrence, « Abolitionnisme, jeu politique et réforme : France, 1814-1848 », dans Pétré Grenouilleau Olivier (dir),  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Abolir l’esclavage.

Toute concession à l’égard de ces derniers est vouée à l’échec. Ils sont donc partisans du maintien du système ségrégationniste et esclavagiste.

Following his family's tradition, he embarked on a military career, eventually becoming a cavalry officer.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Upon learning of the unrest in the English colonies of North America, Lafayette joined the rebels, using his substantial personal wealth to fund the war effort. His involvement in the war earned him a heroic reputation on both sides of the Atlantic. He was involved in the discussions that led to the Treaty of Paris in 1783 and was later appointed field marshal by Louis XVI. Known for his progressive views, he was one of the few nobles to take the oath at the Jeu de Paume during the Estates-General of 1789, signaling the start of the French Revolution. In the days that followed, he penned the original draft Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lafayette was appointed commander of the National Guard, but his popularity waned during the Constituent Assembly due to his moderate stance. Criticized by the royalists and branded a traitor by the Assembly, he was forced into exile in August 1792 and immediately captured. After enduring years of imprisonment and exile, he returned to France in 1800. He generally concealed his opposition to Napoleon, avoiding politics for most of his reign. After Napoleon's escape from Elba, Lafayette was elected to the Chamber of Deputies during the early Restoration and during Napoleon’s short-lived return. Lafayette played a crucial role in securing Napoleon's second abdication. Under Louis XVIII, Lafayette led the left-wing opposition. Following a year-long tour of the United States between 1824 and 1825, he resumed his role in the democratic opposition during Charles X's reign. He was also a leading figure in the July Revolution of 1830, publicly backing Louis-Philippe and aiding in the establishment of a parliamentary monarchy. However, Lafayette soon grew disenchanted with the new regime as it quickly turned autocratic. He died of pneumonia in 1834 after attending the funeral of François-Charles Dulong, a far-left deputy who was killed in a duel by General Thomas Robert Bugeaud.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lafayette's obituary, published in the inaugural issue of the Revue des Colonies, highlighted his commitment to abolitionism, which appears to have grown out of his first visit to the United States. In a 1783 letter to George Washington, Lafayette proposed that they jointly purchase a plantation to employ freed slaves. Although Washington did not agree, Lafayette carried out this plan two years later on a plantation in Guyana. He was one of the founding members of the abolitionist Société des Amis des Noirs in France in 1788 and advocated for civil rights for people of color at the Constituent Assembly. Throughout his political career, Lafayette consistently supported abolitionist causes, even radical ones. He served as the lifelong vice-president of the American Colonization Society, frequently spoke out against the illegal slave trade in the French parliament, and expressed his support for Haiti years before France officially recognized the country in 1825.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Étienne Taillemitte, “La Fayette et l’abolition de l’esclavage,”  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">L'esclave et les plantations : de l'établissement de la servitude à son abolition.

Suivant la tradition familiale il poursuit une carrière militaire et devient officier de cavalerie. Informé des troubles agitant les colonies anglaises d’Amérique du Nord, Lafayette rejoint les insurgés, faisant usage de sa colossale fortune personnelle pour soutenir l’effort de guerre. Son engagement fait de lui un héros des deux côtés de l’Atlantique. Il participe aux discussions menant au Traité de Paris en 1783, et se voit nommé maréchal de camp par Louis XVI. Connu pour ses convictions progressistes, il est un des rares représentants de la noblesse à prêter serment au Jeu de Paume aux États-Généraux de 1789. Il rédige dans les journées qui suivent le premier jet de la Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Nommé à la tête de la Garde Nationale, Lafayette perd en popularité durant la Constituante du fait de sa position modérée. Décrié par les royalistes et déclaré traître à la nation à l’Assemblée, il s’exile en août 1792. De retour en France en 1800, après des années d’emprisonnement et d’exil, son opposition à Napoléon reste silencieuse jusqu’aux Cent Jours; élu à la Chambre, il joue un rôle clé dans la seconde abdication. Il devient chef de file de l’opposition de gauche sous Louis XVIII. Après une tournée triomphale aux États-Unis entre 1824 et 1825, il reprend son rôle dans l’opposition démocratique aux velléités absolutistes de Charles X. Au premier rang de la révolution de Juillet, il apporte soutien à Louis-Philippe, contribuant à faire accepter la monarchie parlementaire. La rapide dérive autocratique du nouveau régime pousse Lafayette de nouveau dans l’opposition. Il meurt d’une pneumonie en 1834, après avoir assisté à l’enterrement de François-Charles Dulong, député d’extrême-gauche tué en duel par le général Bugeaud.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">La nécrologie de Lafayette publiée dans le premier numéro de la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title> souligne l’engagement abolitionniste de l’homme d’état, qui semble dater de sa visite aux États-Unis. Une lettre à George Washington datant de 1783, le montre essayant de convaincre le général américain de se joindre à lui pour acquérir une plantation qui emploierait des affranchis. Si Washington n’en fit rien, Lafayette mit ce projet en place deux années plus tard, dans une plantation de Guyane. Il fut parmi les premiers membres de la Société des Amis des Noirs, fondée en France en 1788, et se prononça à la Constituante en faveur des droits civiques pour les gens de couleur. La carrière politique de Lafayette sera caractérisée jusque dans les dernières années de sa vie par un des prises de position en soutien aux efforts abolitionnistes, modérés comme radicaux. Il deviendra notamment vice-président à vie de l’American Colonization Society, combattra la traite clandestine, et se positionnera en soutien à Haïti avant même que le pays ne soit officiellement reconnu par la France.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Étienne Taillemitte, « La Fayette et l’abolition de l’esclavage »,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">L'esclave et les plantations : de l'établissement de la servitude à son abolition.

The son of Régis Dessalles and Manon d’Albis de Gissac, he married Anna Bence de Sainte-Catherine, a white Creole from Le Lamentin, in Fort-Royal, the administrative capital of the Martinique colony on October 6, 1808.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Despite his metropolitan origin, Pierre Dessalles became the epitome of a white settler due to his family background and marital alliance. He pursued a career in the judiciary as a counselor at the Court of Appeal of Martinique, initially as an assessor on January 4, 1809, and later as a full counselor on January 4, 1812. In this capacity, he played a role in the Bissette case (1823-1824), securing the conviction of Cyrille Auguste Bissette to life imprisonment with hard labor and branding with the letters GAL (Galley Slave).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Subsequently, he assumed the role of counselor at the Royal Court of Martinique on October 5, 1828, and also held the position of captain in the colony's militias starting from February 25, 1829. However, his tenure as interim Attorney General at the Court of Appeal, which began on June 16, 1831, was short-lived, as he resigned on July 31 of the same year, was suspended on August 4, 1832, and ultimately dismissed on September 19, 1832.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Beyond his legal career, Pierre Dessalles owned plantations, sugar refineries, and coffee estates in Sainte-Marie, a town in the north Atlantic region of Martinique. Familiar with intricacies of Martinique’s colonial slave society, he explored the subject in his book “Life of a Settler in Martinique in the 19th Century” (1808-1856). This publication explored significant events such as the uprisings of enslaved people in 1811 and 1831, the Bissette affair of 1823-1824, the Grande Anse affair of 1833, and the early stages of the abolition of slavery in Martinique.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Henri de Frémont,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Histoire et généalogie de la famille Dessalles ou Des Salles</tei-title> ,  <tei-ref target=\"\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">https://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?lang=fr&amp;p=pierre&amp;n=dessalles&amp;oc=3</tei-ref> .</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Abel Alexis Louis,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Marchands et négociants de couleur à Saint-Pierre (1777-1830) : milieux socioprofessionnels, fortune et mode de vie</tei-title> , Paris, L’Harmattan, 2015.</tei-bibl>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Person\" resp=\"#abel\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Né à Castillonnès dans le département du Lot-et-Garonne, il décède le 5 mars 1857 à Brest à l’âge de 71 ans. Pierre François Marie Dieudonné Dessalles, plus connu en tant que Pierre Dessalles, était le fils de Régis Dessalles et de Manon d’Albis de Gissac. Marié le 6 octobre 1808 à Fort-Royal, capitale administrative de la colonie de la Martinique, à Anna Bence de Sainte-Catherine, blanche créole du Lamentin, Pierre Dessalles, bien que métropolitain, fut l’archétype du colon blanc par sa famille paternelle et maternelle, ainsi que par son alliance matrimoniale. Il fit une carrière dans la magistrature en tant que conseiller à la Cour d’appel de la Martinique (assesseur le 4 janvier 1809, titulaire le 4 janvier 1812). C’est à ce titre qu’il prit part à l’affaire Bissette (1823-1824) et fit condamner Cyrille Auguste Bissette aux galères à perpétuité et à être marqué au fer rouge des lettres GAL (Galérien). Puis, il fut conseiller à la Cour royale de la Martinique le 5 octobre 1828. Il fut aussi capitaine dans les milices de la colonie le 25 février 1829. Nommé ensuite procureur général par intérim à la Cour d’appel le 16 juin 1831, il fut démissionnaire le 31 juillet suivant, suspendu le 4 août 1832, et destitué le 19 septembre 1832. L’homme fut aussi propriétaire d’habitations, sucrerie et caféière à Sainte-Marie, commune du nord atlantique de la Martinique.

Coming from a family of farmers, this lawyer published several essays in 1823 and 1828 dedicated to the abolition of slavery. He co-founded the French Society for the Abolition of Slavery and was renowned for his numerous speeches in the Chamber of Deputies advocating for the abolition of slavery.

The lawyer's role in the affair of the deportees from Martinique (1823-1824) initially forged bonds, but these weakened over the years. The proposals made by the abolitionist during the 1830s did not appear to satisfy Cyrille Bissette, who grew increasingly critical. Isambert, for his part, distanced himself from the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue des Colonies</tei-emph> and Bissette, criticizing \"the violence and the personalities that dominate it.\" The final break seems to have occurred in 1841, over a matter involving \"the honor of a woman,\" about which Isambert preferred to remain silent.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Isambert, François,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Lettre de M.

Les propositions formulées par l'abolitionniste dans les années 1830 ne semblent pas satisfaire Cyrille Bissette, qui se montre critique. Isambert, de son côté, se tient à distance de la <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue des Colonies</tei-emph> et de Bissette. Il dénonce « la violence et les personnalités qui y règnent ». La rupture semble scellée en 1841, autour d'une histoire qui engageait « l'honneur d'une femme » et sur laquelle Isambert préfère garder le secret.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Isambert, François,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Lettre de M.

Though there is no historical consensus on his date of birth, Toussaint Louverture (as he eventually came to be known) was born sometime in the early 1740s on the Bréda plantation near the village of Haut-du-Cap in northern Saint Domingue. A creole—that is, born in the colony and not in Africa—he was known in his early years as Toussaint Bréda, after the name of his plantation owner. He rose to the position of coachmen to the manager of the Bréda plantation and, eventually, obtained his emancipation. Archival records reveal him to be legally emancipated by 1776 and a slaveowner himself, renting a coffee plantation from his son-in-law where none other than Jean-Jacques Dessalines was among the enslaved laborers. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">During the revolutionary period, Louverture joined early on with the insurgents Biassou and Jean-François who were backed by the Spanish crown. In 1794, he ended his alliance with the Spanish and proclaimed his allegiance with the French Republic. Louverture ascended the ranks of the army in Saint-Domingue, becoming brigadier-general in 1795, governor-general in 1796, and in 1797, commander-in-chief of the Saint-Domingue army. In 1800, he defeated rival southern general André Rigaud in a civil war known as the War of Knives, unifying French Saint-Domingue under his control and, briefly, the eastern side of the island. In 1801, he promulgated a constitution for Saint-Domingue that maintained the territory’s colonial status and elevated him to Governor-for-life.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">When the Leclerc expedition arrived on the northern shore of the island in early 1802, Louverture challenged its legitimacy refused officers’ entry to the island. He and his troops resisted; he was declared an outlaw and, eventually, agreed to surrender and retire from government. This was not enough for Bonaparte who had Leclerc trick, capture, and deport Louverture. He spent his final days imprisoned in the Fort de Joux in the Jura Mountains. He petitioned Bonaparte to grant him a military tribunal to clear his name and end his unlawful imprisonment. His <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">mémoire </tei-emph>and letters went unanswered. Louverture died in prison on April 7, 1803. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bénot, Yves and Dorigny, Marcel, eds.,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Rétablissement de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises. </tei-emph> <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Aux origines de Haïti</tei-emph>   .

Sa date de naissance demeure incertaine, mais il voit le jour au début des années 1740 sur l’habitation Bréda, près du Haut-du-Cap, dans le nord de Saint-Domingue. Créole — c’est-à-dire né dans la colonie et non en Afrique — il est d’abord connu sous le nom de Toussaint Bréda, en référence au domaine où il grandit. Il accède au poste de cocher du régisseur de l’habitation avant d’obtenir son affranchissement. Les archives attestent de son émancipation légale en 1776 et de son statut ultérieur de propriétaire d’esclaves, exploitant une plantation de café louée à son gendre, où Jean-Jacques Dessalines figure parmi les travailleurs asservis.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lorsque la Révolution éclate, Louverture rejoint les insurgés Biassou et Jean-François, soutenus par la couronne espagnole. En 1794, il rompt cette alliance et se rallie à la République française. Il gravit rapidement les échelons de l’armée de Saint-Domingue, devenant général de brigade en 1795, gouverneur général en 1796, puis commandant en chef des forces de l’île en 1797. En 1800, il défait André Rigaud lors de la guerre civile connue sous le nom de <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Guerre des Couteaux</tei-emph>, unifiant Saint-Domingue sous son autorité et prenant brièvement le contrôle de sa partie orientale. En 1801, il promulgue une constitution qui maintient le territoire sous statut colonial tout en le désignant gouverneur à vie.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lorsque l’expédition Leclerc débarque sur les côtes nord de l’île en 1802, Louverture en conteste la légitimité et refuse aux officiers français l’accès au territoire. Ses troupes opposent une résistance farouche, mais il est déclaré hors-la-loi. Après plusieurs mois de combats, il accepte de se rendre et de se retirer de la vie politique. Cette reddition ne suffit pas à Bonaparte, qui ordonne à Leclerc de le capturer et de le déporter. Louverture est emprisonné au Fort de Joux, dans les montagnes du Jura, où il passe ses derniers mois. Il adresse plusieurs lettres à Bonaparte, demandant un tribunal militaire pour défendre son honneur et contester sa détention arbitraire. Ses requêtes restent sans réponse. Il meurt en captivité le 7 avril 1803.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bénot, Yves et Dorigny, Marcel, eds.,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Rétablissement de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises. </tei-emph> <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Aux origines de Haïti</tei-emph>   .

From this family name, there were variants and branch names like Perrinelle-Dumay. Perhaps it was Louis Nicolas Honoré Perrinelle-Dumay (1770-1858), Councilor and Président of the Royal Court of Martinique, or perhaps it is Louis Perrinelle-Dumay, born in 1801, licensed in law in 1821, hearing officer the same year at the Royal Court of Martinique. He is one of the nine titular advisors of this court judging Cyrille Bissette during the case bearing his name. His name appears at the bottom of the judgment of January 12, 1824 rendered by the Royal Court  against Bissette and his co-defendants. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Pâme, Stella.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Cyrille Bissette: un martyr de la liberté</tei-title> .

He was the son of Jean-Pierre Clavier, also known as Berne Clavier, master of seines, an estate owner and enslaver, and Jeanne-Catherine-Françoise Kaire. He likely did his first apprenticeships with teachers color in Fort-Royal He continued his university studies in mainland France and earned his medical degree from the faculty of Paris in 1834. He married Jeanne-Rose Patterson in Castries (St Lucia) on June 24, 1840. It is probable he found it easier to practice medicine in Saint Lucia than on his native island.

He also sat on the commission on slavery and the colonies chaired by the abolitionist Victor de Broglie between 1840 and 1843. He briefly served as Minister of the Navy and Colonies under the Second Republic, putting an end to his political career after Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte’s coup of December 2, 1851. Like the better-known Victor Schœlcher, Destutt de Tracy also campaigned against capital punishment.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Jennings, Lawrence C.,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">La France et l’abolition de l’esclavage (1802-1848)</tei-title>  , Bruxelles, André Versaille, 2010.</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Schmidt, Nelly.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Abolitionnistes de l'esclavage et réformateurs des colonies, 1820-1851: analyses et documents</tei-title> .

In official documents, he referred to himself as a “mulatto”. Fabien established a successful career as a merchant, further supported by 43,800 pounds acquired in his 1819 marriage to Marie Elisabeth Justine Rogemont, a fellow free person of color whose father owned a valuable sugar refinery in Le Francois. The couple’s significant estate included enslaved people. Fabien fils was arrested in December 1823, alongside Cyrille Bissette, Jean-Baptiste Volny and others for allegedly distributing a pamphlet on the situation of free people of color, demanding civil and political equality with white colonists. In 1824, the group was convicted, branded with hot irons, and sentenced to lifetime imprisonment before this punishment was ultimately reduced to banishment from the colonies. In Paris, Fabien fils gained prominence as an activist alongside Mondesir Richard, taking part in the founding of the Société des hommes de couleur, which advocated for the rights of free people of color in the colonies. He subsequently worked with Bissette on the Revue des Colonies while authoring numerous political pamphlets. He died in 1852 in St. Pierre after having fallen out with Bissette toward the end of his life.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                    <tei-strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-28846eef-7fff-5788-9c4a-bc27d23c19da\" data-origname=\"strong\" data-origatts=\"id\" data-empty=\"\"/>\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Louis, Abel Alexis,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Les libres de couleur en Martinique.

Il est lui-même qualifié de mulâtre dans les actes d’état civil et/ou de notariat. Exerçant la profession de marchand, voire même de négociant, et jouissant d’une certaine aisance économique car apportant 43.800 livres coloniales dans son contrat de mariage le 16 février 1819, il fut aussi propriétaire de maisons et d’esclaves et s’unit en outre à Marie Elisabeth Justine Rogemont, métisse libre, descendante de “Caraïbe” par son père, propriétaire pour un quart d’une habitation sucrerie au François d’une valeur de 120.000 livres coloniales. Louis Fabien fils est arrêté en décembre 1823 avec Cyrille Bissette et Jean-Baptiste Volny notamment pour avoir introduit en Martinique et colporté une brochure ou libelle sur la situation des gens de couleur libres demandant l’égalité civile et politique pour ceux-ci avec les blancs. Partageant le sort de Bissette et de Volny, il est condamné comme eux en janvier 1824 au marquage au fer rouge et au bagne à perpétuité, puis, libéré avec une peine de bannissement des colonies françaises. Fabien fils est l’un des fondateurs à Paris de la Société des hommes de couleur en 1832. De la lutte pour l’égalité des libres de couleur des Antilles françaises, Fabien fils, comme Bissette, devient ensuite au cours des années 1832-1835, l’un des principaux militants pour l’abolition immédiate de l’esclavage, aux côtés de Mondésir Richard notamment. Collaborateur de la Revue des Colonies fondée par Cyrille Bissette en 1834, il est aussi l’auteur de nombreuses brochures.

In 1789, 90% of its population of almost half a million consisted of enslaved people, who produced three quarters of the world's sugar.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The mass uprisings of enslaved people that began there 1791 prompted the proclamation of local emancipation in 1793, followed by legislative elections in which the newly enfranchised took part, electing deputies Mills, Dufaÿ, and Belley, the first Black parliamentarian, to represent the colony in the National Convention. In Paris, these deputies encourage the Convention to decree complete and immediate abolition in all French colonies on February 4, 1794. Saint-Domingue was then governed by the formerly enslaved general Toussaint Louverture, who sought to guarantee the autonomy of the colony by drafting a constitution emancipating it from metropolitan institutions. In 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte, as First Consul, ordered the reconquest of the colony and the reestablishment of slavery. When Louverture is imprisoned, his second, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, takes the lead of the revolutionary movement and imposed, on January 1, 1804, the independence of the former colony under the Arawak name of Haiti. In 1825, President Jean-Baptiste Boyer had King Charles X recognize its legitimacy, at the cost of an indemnity of 150 million francs, effectively suffocating the country's economy.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">That the first total abolition of slavery occured in response to slave insurrections is a testament to the importance and agency of enslaved people within the global struggle for abolition.

Saint-Domingue est alors gouvernée par Toussaint Louverture, ancien affranchi, qui souhaite garantir l’autonomie de l’île en élaborant une constitution qui l’émancipe des institutions métropolitaines. En 1802, le Napoléon Bonaparte, à titre de Premier Consul, ordonne la reconquête de la colonie et le rétablissement de l’esclavage. À l’incarcération de Louverture, son second, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, prend la tête du mouvement révolutionnaire pour imposer, le 1er janvier 1804, l’indépendance de l’ancienne colonie sous le nom arawak d’Haïti.

The port city sits deep in the Gulf of Gonâve, between the northern mountains and southern peninsula. It was not always the capital: during the colonial period, the northern port city of Cap Français (now Cap-Haïtien) served as the colony’s center of power until 1770. It was not always called Port-au-Prince, either: during the first French Republic in Saint-Domingue it was renamed “Port Républicain,” and returned briefly to that name once again after the 1843 revolution in Haiti. It earned another nickname “Port-aux-Crimes,” after a republican faction assassinated Jean-Jacques Dessalines in 1806. Indeed, Dessalines had not kept the seat of power in the port capital but rather in Marchand-Dessalines, located north and inland in the Artibonite Valley. Alexandre Pétion returned the capital of the Haitian Republic to Port-au-Prince during the civil war with Henry Christophe’s state-turned-monarchy in the north. Jean-Pierre Boyer unified the two regions under his republic in Port-au-Prince after Christophe’s death in 1820, though separatist regimes and even presidencies challenged the dominance of Port-au-Prince throughout the nineteenth century. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Corvington, Georges,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Port-au-Prince au cours des ans</tei-title>  , vols. 1–3.

Son nom a également changé au fil des régimes : sous la première République française à Saint-Domingue, elle devient Port-Républicain, un nom qu’elle reprend brièvement après la révolution de 1843.

French presence in the region dated to the early seventeenth century, though wars in Europe led to British takeover and occupation of Saint-Louis from 1759 to 1779 and 1807-1817, and of Gorée from 1758 to 1763, 1779-1783, and 1800-1817. Negotiations with the British at the end of the Napoleonic Wars allowed the French to reclaim control of Senegal in 1817. After 1817, French authorities began to broaden their aims beyond maritime trade to include a wider range of activities. This was evident in the creation of Senegal's first French public schools and hospital, often with assistance from Catholic missionary orders, in the 1810s and 1820s, and perhaps most clearly in agricultural colonization projects. Signing a treaty with the ruler of the Waalo kingdom in 1819, Governor Julien Schmaltz gained land use rights to a parcel along the Senegal River and the right to build a fort at Dagana. During Baron Jacques-François Roger’s tenure as governor (1822-1827), the agricultural project on this parcel, known as Richard Toll, received a lot of attention. Though the Ministry of the Marine and French administration in Senegal admitted by the early 1830s that Richard Toll had failed, it signaled an increasing and ongoing interest in affairs along the Senegal River, which continued into the 1830s and 1840s, and found a place in the pages of Bissette's publication. Bissette also included articles critical of Governor Germain's decision to involve French troops in a war in Waalo from 1833 to 1835, aimed at preventing Waalo from securing an alliance with the Trarzas Moors to the north, and articles on the aftermath of this conflict.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Populations of both Saint-Louis and Gorée included a very small community of metropolitan French people (officials, traders and representatives of merchant firms, missionaries, and others), free Africans who worked as traders, fishermen, sailors, craftsmen, or day laborers; métis or mixed-race people (born to African or mixed women known as signares and French fathers, and their descendants), and--until 1848--a large population of enslaved Africans. Efforts to develop agriculture notwithstanding, commerce dominated the economy, with gum Arabic as the primary export during the period immediately after France’s abolition of the transatlantic slave trade (1815). Later in the nineteenth century, groundnuts or peanuts would come to dominate Senegal’s export trade.</tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Place\" resp=\"#kelly\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">À l’époque de la <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue</tei-emph>, la colonie française du Sénégal se limite aux villes marchandes insulaires de Saint-Louis et Gorée, ainsi qu’à quelques avant-postes, certains fortifiés, le long du fleuve Sénégal et au sud de Gorée. La présence française dans la région remonte au début du XVIIe siècle, bien que les guerres en Europe entraînent l’occupation et le contrôle de Saint-Louis par les Britanniques de 1759 à 1779 et de 1807 à 1817, et de Gorée de 1758 à 1763, de 1779 à 1783, et de 1800 à 1817. Les négociations avec les Britanniques à la fin des guerres napoléoniennes permettent à la France de reprendre le contrôle du Sénégal en 1817.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Après 1817, les autorités françaises élargissent leurs ambitions au-delà du commerce maritime, en s’engageant dans une gamme d’activités plus variées. Cela se manifeste notamment par la création des premières écoles publiques françaises et d’un hôpital au Sénégal, souvent avec l’aide des ordres missionnaires catholiques, dans les années 1810 et 1820. Ces efforts sont particulièrement visibles dans les projets de colonisation agricole. En signant un traité avec le souverain du royaume du Waalo en 1819, le gouverneur Julien Schmaltz obtient des droits d’usage foncier sur une parcelle le long du fleuve Sénégal ainsi que le droit de construire un fort à Dagana. Sous le mandat du baron Jacques-François Roger, gouverneur de 1822 à 1827, le projet agricole sur cette parcelle, connue sous le nom de Richard Toll, reçoit une attention particulière. Bien que le ministère de la Marine et l’administration française au Sénégal admettent dès le début des années 1830 l’échec de Richard Toll, ce projet marque un intérêt croissant et continu pour les affaires le long du fleuve Sénégal, qui se poursuit dans les années 1830 et 1840 et trouve écho dans les pages de la publication de Bissette. Ce dernier inclut également des articles critiques sur la décision du gouverneur Germain d’impliquer les troupes françaises dans une guerre au Waalo entre 1833 et 1835, visant à empêcher le Waalo de conclure une alliance avec les Maures Trarzas au nord, ainsi que des articles sur les conséquences de ce conflit.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Les populations de Saint-Louis et de Gorée comprennent une très petite communauté de Français métropolitains (fonctionnaires, commerçants, représentants de maisons de commerce, missionnaires, et autres), des Africains libres travaillant comme commerçants, pêcheurs, marins, artisans ou journaliers, des métis (nés de femmes africaines ou métisses connues sous le nom de signares et de pères français, ainsi que leurs descendants), et – jusqu’en 1848 – une importante population d’Africains réduits en esclavage. Malgré les efforts de développement agricole, le commerce domine l’économie, avec la gomme arabique comme principal produit d’exportation dans la période suivant immédiatement l’abolition par la France de la traite transatlantique (1815). Plus tard au XIXe siècle, les arachides deviennent le principal produit d’exportation du Sénégal.</tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n        </tei-place>\n        <tei-place xml:id=\"DOM\" id=\"DOM\" data-origname=\"place\" data-origatts=\"xml:id\">\n            <tei-placeName xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Dominique</tei-placeName>\n            <tei-placeName xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" data-origname=\"placeName\" data-origatts=\"xml:lang\">Dominique</tei-placeName>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\" type=\"Place\" resp=\"#masha\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Dominica, located directly between Guadeloupe and Martinique, was first settled by French settlers from these islands in the late seventeenth century, who soon brought in African slaves.

According to the 1788 census, Cayenne’s enslaved population represented just over 80% of the total population. During the Revolution, Cayenne received multiple convoys of exiles from metropolitan France, beginning its eventual transformation into a penal colony in the nineteenth century. The 1794 abolition decree was never meaningfully enforced there. Victor Hugues, the commissioner in charge of enforcing the decree in Guadeloupe, was named governor of Guiana in 1799, replacing slavery with a system of conscripted labor until the official restoration of slavery in 1802 by the decree of First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte. This regression to pre-Revolutionary conditions led to high frequencies of marronage. Conquered by Portuguese forces in 1809, the colony was returned to France in 1817, following the Treaty of Paris.

Issue du premier empire colonial français, voisine du Brésil et du Suriname, cette colonie fondée sur l’économie de plantation devient un lieu de déportation lors de la Révolution française, accueillant plusieurs convois de proscrits. D’après le recensement de 1788, la population esclavisée y représente un peu plus de 80% de la population. L’abolition de l’esclavage, en application du décret de la Convention, y est proclamée le 14 juin 1794. En 1802, Victor Hugues, le commissaire chargé de faire appliquer le décret d’abolition de l’esclavage en Guadeloupe, y impose le rétablissement de l’esclavage promulgué en 1802 par Napoléon Bonaparte, Premier Consul, et instaure un régime de conscription locale. Cette régression aux dispositions antérieures à la Révolution entraîne d’importants mouvements de marronnage.

In 1833, British Parliament proclaimed the abolition of slavery, to be enacted in 1834, culminating in the effective emancipation of all enslaved people in the British colonies by 1838, after a period of “apprenticeship.” The process of British abolition, which occurred in parallel to the first years of publication of the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue</tei-title>, signaled the inevitability of abolition in France, shifting the debate to the question of immediate or gradualist emancipation.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Like other French abolitionists, Bissette received confirmed support from the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society </tei-title>(BFASS), at least for the publication of his short-lived <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue Abolioniste </tei-title>in 1847.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Jennings, Lawrence C. “Slavery and the Venality of the July Monarchy Press.”  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">French Historical Studies</tei-title>  17.4 (1992): 957–78.</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Walvin, James. \"British Abolitionism, 1787-1838.\" In  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">The Abolitions of Slavery: From the LF Sonthonax to Victor Schoelcher, 1793, 1794, 1848</tei-title> ,edited by Marcel Dorigny (New York: Bergham Books, 2003), 71-78</tei-bibl>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Place\" resp=\"#masha\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">À la fois puissance militaire et coloniale rivale de la France et modèle du mouvement abolitionniste français, l’Angleterre bénéficie, au sein de la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue, </tei-title>d’une couverture médiatique particulièrement intéressante.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Adversaire de la France pendant la période révolutionnaire et napoléonienne, la Grande-Bretagne saisit et restitue à plusieurs reprises diverses possessions coloniales françaises.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Quelque peu freiné, dans les années 1790, par les craintes que suscitent les Révolution française et haïtienne, le mouvement abolitionniste britannique se popularise à partir de 1807, sous la double perspective de l’immoralité du maintien de l’esclavage et l’intérêt économique de son abolition.

A slave plantation economy, mainly devoted to sugar monoculture, the island came under British control between 1759 and 1763, and again, in 1794, with the support of planters seeking to avoid the abolition decreed by the National Convention.

Bissette's native island was indeed covered extensively in the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title>, with early issues giving particular attention to the disappointing results of the laws of April 1833, which effectively maintained the exclusion of free men of color from political life by imposing electoral qualifications in the colonies nearly twice as stringent as those in metropolitan France.

Devenue Réunion à la Révolution, puis île Bonaparte sous l’Empire, elle est occupée par les Britanniques entre 1810 et 1814, avant d’être définitivement rendue à la France dans le cadre du traité de Paris. D’abord employée comme escale pour les navires de la Compagnie française des Indes orientales, l’île intègre, dans la première moitié du 18e siècle, le modèle de la société de plantation esclavagiste. D’après le recensement de 1788, environ 80% de la population de l’île, d’origine africaine, malgache, ou indienne, est esclavisée. L’esclavagisme bourbonnais repose, par ailleurs, sur une politique de division éthnique d’africains, de malgaches et d’indiens dans le but d’éviter la constitution d’un groupe majoritaire menaçant pour l’ordre colonial. L’abolition décrétée par la Convention le 4 février 1794, n’y est jamais appliquée et les actes de résistance, notamment le marronnage, sont répandus.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Comme c’est le cas dans d’autres territoires coloniaux, la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies </tei-title>y dispose d’un distributeur et d’un correspondant chargé de rendre compte de l’actualité de l’île.

As a slave economy primarily devoted to sugar cultivation, the island’s enslaved population represented approximately 85% of the total, per the 1789 census, with 13% white and 3% “free people of color.” The archipelago came under British control between 1759 and 1763, and was briefly occupied again in 1794, following the National Convention’s abolition decree. This occupation was, however, expelled by military forces including several thousand newly emancipated men, led by Victor Hugues, the civil commissioner sent by the Convention to enforce the abolition decree. The implementation of this abolition was, however, largely symbolic, with chattel slavery replaced, in many instances, by forced labor. In 1802, a large insurrectionary army commanded by Louis Delgrès, a free man of color, opposed the French General Richepanse, who had been sent to restore slavery on the orders of Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul. The brutally repressed insurrection would end with the suicide of Delgrès and his company.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Guadeloupe again came under British control during the Napoleonic Wars. Briefly ceded to Sweden during the Treaty of Paris in 1814, it definitively returned to French control in 1815. At the time of the foundation of the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title>, the population of free people of color equaled the white population, and owned about a quarter of the land. The <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue</tei-title> gives significant attention to current events in Guadeloupe, likely through the efforts of Mondésir Richard, a “<tei-title data-origname=\"title\">mandataire</tei-title> of the free people of color of Guadeloupe\" and apparent member of the “Society of men of color” who founded the periodical.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Dorigny, Marcel, and Bernard Gainot, eds.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Atlas des esclavages.

L’utilisation de l’expression <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">« hommes de couleur »</tei-emph> en 1834 est particulièrement significative car ces lois auraient dû, en principe, en abolir l’usage en lui ôtant sa valeur juridique par la suppression de toute distinction légale entre les hommes de couleur libres et les colons blancs.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Braun, Juliane.  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Creole Drama: Theatre and Society in Antebellum New Orleans</tei-title> .

The main functions of these colonial councils pertain to the administrative organization and the budget of the colony. More broadly, the members of the colonial councils debate and vote on all matters concerning the internal affairs of the colony. They meet during an annual ordinary session and can be convened for extraordinary sessions by the governor.  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Each colony has 30 members, elected for five-year terms through a censitary voting system. Article 21 of the Legislative Regime of the Colonies, dated April 24, 1833, stipulates: “Eligible for the position of a member of the colonial council is any voter aged 30 or older, paying 600 francs in direct contributions in Martinique and Guadeloupe, or 400 francs in Bourbon Island and Guyana, and proving ownership of movable or immovable property in the colony valued at 60,000 francs in Martinique and Guadeloupe, and 40,000 francs in Bourbon Island and Guyana.”  </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Free people of color in the colonies, particularly in Martinique, deem this property and tax requirement excessively high. Nevertheless, Eugène Clavier, a sugar planter of color, manages to join the council in 1845. This triggers a controversy within the colony. Tradition dictates that the governor formally invites all representatives of the colony to a dinner at the opening of the session. Governor Mathieu, “yielding,” according to Bissette, “to the suggestions of certain council members” who allegedly stated that they “did not wish to dine at the same table, side by side with a mulatto,” decides not to invite Clavier.  </tei-p>\n            </tei-note>\n            <tei-note xml:lang=\"fr\" lang=\"fr\" type=\"Organization\" resp=\"#jessica\" data-origname=\"note\" data-origatts=\"resp type xml:lang\">\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">La loi du 24 avril 1833 crée les conseils coloniaux, qui succèdent aux conseils généraux, et la tête desquels se trouvent les gouverneurs des colonies.

Negotiations for recognition failed under Dessalines, Pétion and Christophe, as various early independence governments balked at France’s terms and French agents’ continued designs on the land they continue to refer to under the colonial name of Saint-Domingue. President Jean-Pierre Boyer (1818–1843) attempted his own negotiations with France but his hand was ultimately forced when Charles X’s emissary, Baron Mackau, arrived with a military squadron in the harbor of Port-au-Prince with a new ordonnance from the king (dated April 17, 1825). The order stated that Haiti would give France preferential trade status via a reduced customs duty and pay a staggering 150 million francs to compensate French property owners for their “loss.” Boyer signed, under the threat of gunboats, on July 11, 1825.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Boyer’s government immediately took out a loan to make their first payment—borrowing 30 million francs from French banks in order to repay the French government for recognition of their independence. The indemnity agreement and the loans had disastrous consequences for the economic and political autonomy of the nation. Economists have estimated the total cost of the indemnity to Haiti over the last 200 years to be at least $21 billion dollars, perhaps as much as $115 billion.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                    <tei-ref target=\"https://memoire-esclavage.org/lordonnance-de-charles-x-sur-lindemnite-dhaiti\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">https://memoire-esclavage.org/lordonnance-de-charles-x-sur-lindemnite-dhaiti</tei-ref>\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                    <tei-ref target=\"https://esclavage-indemnites.fr/public/Base/1\" data-origname=\"ref\" data-origatts=\"target\">https://esclavage-indemnites.fr/public/Base/1</tei-ref>\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Blancpain, François,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Un siècle de relations financières entre Haïti et la France (1825-1922)</tei-title>  .

Sous Dessalines, Pétion et Christophe, les négociations en ce sens échouent, les premiers gouvernements haïtiens refusant d’accepter les conditions imposées par la France, tandis que les agents français continuent à revendiquer le territoire sous son nom colonial de Saint-Domingue.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Le président Jean-Pierre Boyer (1818–1843) entreprend à son tour des négociations avec la France, mais la situation prend un tournant décisif lorsque l’émissaire de Charles X, le baron Mackau, arrive dans le port de Port-au-Prince à la tête d’une escadre militaire, porteur d’une ordonnance royale datée du 17 avril 1825. Celle-ci stipule qu’Haïti doit accorder à la France un statut commercial préférentiel, par le biais d’une réduction des droits de douane, et verser une indemnité de 150 millions de francs pour compenser les propriétaires français de la « perte » de leurs biens.

The law, proposed by First Consul Bonaparte and debated by the assemblies, was adopted on May 20, 1802 (30 floréal an 10).</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">The pertinent text of the law is as follows:</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Article 1: “Dans les colonies restituées à la France en exécution du traité d’Amiens, du 6 germinal an X, l’esclavage sera maintenu conformément aux lois et réglemens antérieures à 1789.”<tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>Article 3: “La traite des noirs et leur importation des lesdites colonies, auront lieu, conformément aux lois et règlemens existans avant ladite époque de 1789.”</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Slavery had been abolished first in Saint Domingue in 1793 by civil commissioners Leger-Félicité Sonthonax and Étienne Polverel. A committee from Saint-Domingue then sailed to France to urge the government to ratify the 1793 proclamations for all French colonies. On February 4, 1794 the Convention proclaimed slavery abolished throughout the Republic. Though applied in Guadeloupe and, eventually, Guyana, the 1794 decree was not applied in Martinique, Saint Lucia or Tobago (then under British occupation) or in the Indian Ocean colonies (which essentially delayed and refused). The Treaty of Amiens signed March 15, 1802 with Great Britain thus restored to France those colonies that had maintained slavery and the slave trade throughout the period of occupation. The May 20 law did not reestablish slavery throughout the French colonies but was nevertheless a stark retreat from the values of 1789: slavery and the slave trade was now legal in the French Republic. A consular order from July 16, 1802 (27 messidor an X) reestablished slavery in Guadeloupe. </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">There is a lack of clarity, both in contemporary scholarship and in the <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue</tei-emph>, on the nature of the May 20 decree-law. Scholars often incorrectly cite the law as the date that marks Bonaparte’s reestablishment of slavery throughout the French colonies. Bissette’s exaggerated claim, “Tout le monde sait que la loi de floréal an 10, qui rétablit l’esclavage dans les colonies, fut le signal de la défection de tous les chefs de Saint-Domingue” reveals that this confusion was in place even in 1830s. It also confirms the effectiveness of Bonaparte’s attempts to reestablish slavery under the radar and without fanfare. Nevertheless, Bissette is correct about the consequences of Bonaparte and the Consulate’s pro-slavery machinations in contributing to the anticolonial, antislavery act of Haitian independence. </tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Niort, Jean-François and Richard, Jérémie, “ A propos de la découverte de l’arrêté consulaire du 16 juillet 1802 et du rétablissement de l’ancien ordre colonial (spécialement de l’esclavage) à la Guadeloupe,”  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Bulletin de la Société d’Histoire de la Guadeloupe</tei-emph>  no. 152 (2009). 31–59. https://doi.org/10.7202/1036868ar</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bénot, Yves and Dorigny, Marcel, eds.,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Rétablissement de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises. </tei-emph> <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Aux origines de Haïti</tei-emph>   .

Un comité mandaté par la colonie s’était alors rendu en France pour plaider en faveur d’une généralisation de cette mesure. Le 4 février 1794, la Convention nationale décréta l’abolition de l’esclavage dans l’ensemble de la République. Ce décret fut appliqué en Guadeloupe et, plus tard, en Guyane, mais resta sans effet en Martinique, à Sainte-Lucie et à Tobago, alors sous occupation britannique, ainsi que dans les colonies de l’océan Indien, où son application fut délibérément différée.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Le traité d’Amiens, signé avec la Grande-Bretagne le 15 mars 1802, permit à la France de récupérer plusieurs colonies où l’esclavage et la traite avaient été maintenus sous administration britannique. La loi du 20 mai 1802 ne rétablissait pas formellement l’esclavage dans l’ensemble des territoires français, mais elle marquait une rupture avec les principes de 1789 en entérinant la légalité de l’esclavage et de la traite dans certaines colonies. Quelques mois plus tard, un arrêté consulaire du 16 juillet 1802 (27 messidor an X) confirma explicitement le rétablissement de l’esclavage en Guadeloupe.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Tant l’historiographie contemporaine que la <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Revue des Colonies</tei-emph> entretiennent une certaine confusion quant à la portée exacte du décret du 20 mai.

L’affirmation de Cyrille Bissette—« Tout le monde sait que la loi de floréal an 10, qui rétablit l’esclavage dans les colonies, fut le signal de la défection de tous les chefs de Saint-Domingue »—illustre bien que cette lecture erronée existait déjà dans les années 1830. Elle témoigne également du succès de la stratégie de Bonaparte, qui chercha à rétablir l’esclavage de manière discrète, sans déclaration officielle retentissante. Pourtant, Bissette ne se trompe pas sur les effets des politiques du Consulat : les manœuvres pro-esclavagistes de Bonaparte contribuèrent directement à l’acte d’indépendance haïtien, dont la portée fut à la fois anticoloniale et antiesclavagiste.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">\n                </tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">https://memoire-esclavage.org/napoleon-et-le-retablissement-de-lesclavage/lessentiel-dossier-<tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>napoleon-et-le-retablissement-de</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\"><tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>https://www.portail-esclavage-reunion.fr/documentaires/abolition-de-l-esclavage/l-abolition-de-l-<tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>esclavage-a-la-reunion/la-premiere-abolition-de-lesclavage-par-la-france-et-sa-non-application-<tei-br data-origname=\"br\" data-empty=\"\"/>a-la-reunion/</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Niort, Jean-François et Richard, Jérémie, “ A propos de la découverte de l’arrêté consulaire du 16 juillet 1802 et du rétablissement de l’ancien ordre colonial (spécialement de l’esclavage) à la Guadeloupe,”  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Bulletin de la Société d’Histoire de la Guadeloupe</tei-emph>  no. 152 (2009). 31–59. https://doi.org/10.7202/1036868ar</tei-bibl>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Bénot, Yves et Dorigny, Marcel, eds.,  <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Rétablissement de l’esclavage dans les colonies françaises. </tei-emph> <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">Aux origines de Haïti</tei-emph>   .

An important cultural signifier, it was referenced frequently in other publications, in fiction, and likely in contemporary discussions. Its title, derived from the verb <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">monere</tei-emph>, meaning to warn or advise, gestures at Enlightenment and Revolutionary ideals of intelligent counsel.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Initially, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Le Moniteur universel</tei-title> was merely a subtitle of the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Gazette Nationale</tei-title>, established in 1789 by Charles-Joseph Panckouke, who also published Diderot and d’Alembert’s <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Encyclopédie</tei-title>.

Under the Empire, it gained the privilege of publishing government acts and official communications, effectively becoming the Empire's primary propaganda outlet. However, its role was not confined to this function. It survived various political regimes, including the Revolution and the death of Panckouke in 1798. Its longevity can be attributed to its adaptability, with its successive iterations reflecting the political culture of each historical stage, transitioning from an encyclopedic model during the Revolution, to a state propaganda tool during the First Empire, to a collection of political speeches under the constitutional monarchy and the Second Republic, and finally, to a daily opinion newspaper for the general public under Napoleon III.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">During the print run of the <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title>, the “Moniteur” was divided into two main sections: the “official” and the “unofficial” part. Government documents and official communications were published in the official section, while other current events and various topics were featured in the unofficial section under a range of headings such as “Domestic,” “International,” “Entertainment,” etc. The texts cited in <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title> were most often found in the unofficial section, typically under the “Domestic” heading and on the front page.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Titles containing the label “Moniteur” followed by a toponym abounded throughout the nineteenth century: local or colonial titles used this formula to emphasize their official status, maintaining the distinction between the official and unofficial sections.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Laurence Guellec, « Les journaux officiels »,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">La Civilisation du journal</tei-title>  (dir.

Ce titre, qui renvoie au langage des Lumières et de la Révolution, dérive étymologiquement du verbe <tei-emph data-origname=\"emph\">monere</tei-emph>, signifiant avertir ou conseiller. Il n’est d’abord que le sous-titre de la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Gazette nationale</tei-title>, créée en 1789 par Charles-Joseph Panckouke, éditeur entre autres de l’<tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Encyclopédie</tei-title> de Diderot et d’Alembert ; ce n’est qu’en 1811 que le sous-titre, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Le Moniteur universel</tei-title>, devient officiellement titre.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">Lancé en 1789, ce périodique devient en 1799 l’organe officiel du gouvernement consulaire ; il obtient ensuite, sous l’Empire, le privilège de la publication des actes du gouvernement et des communications officielles, passant de fait au statut d’« organe de propagande cardinal de l’Empire ». Il ne se limite pourtant pas à cette fonction, et survit aux différents régimes politiques comme il a survécu à la Révolution et à la mort de Panckouke en 1798. Sa survie est notamment liée à sa capacité à changer : les modèles adoptés par sa rédaction, qu'ils soient choisis ou imposés par le pouvoir en place, reflètent de manière révélatrice la culture politique propre à chaque période marquante de son histoire. Ainsi, comme le souligne Laurence Guellec, il se transforme en une grande encyclopédie pendant la Révolution, devient un instrument de propagande étatique sous le Premier Empire, se mue en recueil des discours des orateurs durant la monarchie constitutionnelle et la Seconde République, puis se positionne en tant que quotidien grand public et journal d'opinion sous le règne de Napoléon III. Ajoutons enfin que les titres constitués du syntagme « Moniteur » suivi d’un toponyme sont nombreux, au cours du siècle, en France : les titres locaux ou coloniaux adoptent cette formule pour mettre en exergue leur ancrage officiel, et respectent la distinction entre partie officielle et non officielle.</tei-p>\n                <tei-p data-origname=\"p\">À l’époque de la <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Revue des Colonies</tei-title>, <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">Le Moniteur universel</tei-title> est organisé en deux grandes parties : la « partie officielle » et la « partie non officielle ». Les actes du gouvernement et les communications officielles, quand il y en a, sont publiés dans la partie officielle, en une – mais parfois en quelques lignes – et les autres textes, tous d’actualité mais aux thèmes divers, paraissent dans la partie non officielle sous des rubriques elles aussi variées : intérieur, nouvelles extérieures, spectacles, etc. Les textes que cite la Revue des Colonies paraissent dans la partie non officielle, le plus souvent sous la rubrique « Intérieur » et en une.</tei-p>\n                <tei-bibl data-origname=\"bibl\">Laurence Guellec, « Les journaux officiels »,  <tei-title data-origname=\"title\">La Civilisation du journal</tei-title>  (dir.
