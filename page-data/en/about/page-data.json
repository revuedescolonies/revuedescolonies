This edition has been encoded according to the P5 Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Each issue and corresponding translation is transcribed into a TEI file.

Many of the editorial choices within the edition are motivated by considerations of accessibility. Spellings, for instance, appear modernized by default, though an option to view the text with original spellings (reflecting conventions predating widespread 1835 orthographic reforms) is available through the edition's interface. Each page can easily be switched between original French, modernized French, or English translation, with notes, including bibliographic references, available in either language.
